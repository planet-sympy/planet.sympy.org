						<div><p><em>Thank you to Ond&#345;ej &#268;ert&#237;k, Oscar Benjamin, Travis Oliphant, and Pamela Chestek for reviewing this blog post. Any errors in the post are my own.</em></p>
<p>On April 19, 2022, for approximately 11.5 hours, the <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/">documentation website</a> for the open source <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> project and the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_doc">corresponding GitHub repository</a> were taken down as a result of a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/04/2022-04-15-hackerrank.md">DMCA takedown notice</a> submitted by WorthIT Solutions on behalf of HackerRank. In this post, I&#8217;d like to explain what the DMCA is and how it works, detail exactly what happened with this incident, and go over my views on the incident and some of the lessons we&#8217;ve learned as a result.</p>
<h2>What is the DMCA?</h2>
<p><em>The information in this section has been drawn from various sources, including:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/DMCA-QA.pdf">&#8220;Your DMCA Safe Harbor Questions Answered&#8221;</a> Mitchell Zimmerman (2017)</em></li>
<li><em>The EFF&#8217;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-16-years-under-dmca">Unintended Consequences - 16 Years Under the DMCA</a> (2014)</em></li>
<li><em>GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy">DMCA Takedown Policy</a> page</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a US law that was passed in 1998. It has laid the groundwork for how copyright is enforced in the age of the internet. One of the DMCA provisions that is important to understand is the so-called &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provision. The safe harbor provision, roughly speaking, makes it so that websites can avoid liability because they are simply hosting or transmitting copyrighted content on behalf of their end-users.</p>
<p>The safe harbor provision has been absolutely essential to the modern internet. Without it, a website like GitHub could not exist. Imagine if every time someone found their copyrighted content had been uploaded to GitHub without their permission, that they could sue GitHub for damages. If this were the case, GitHub could never operate. The way GitHub works today, it cannot possibly know if every single thing that is uploaded to it is done so legally. The safe harbor provision also makes modern social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube possible.</p>
<p>However, in order for a website to have and maintain safe harbor status, it must follow certain practices as outlined by the DMCA. In particular, sites must manage the &#8220;notice-and-take-down process&#8221;. GitHub&#8217;s notice-and-take-down process is described in its <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy">DMCA takedown policy</a>.</p>
<p>The notice-and-take-down process works like this: a provider (like GitHub) has a means for a copyright holder to submit a notice. In GitHub&#8217;s case, they provide an online <a href="https://github.com/contact/dmca">form</a>. This notice must include certain information, including the name and address of the submitter, identification of the copyrighted work, the material on the site that is infringing copyright, and a statement of good faith, signed under penalty of perjury, that the person submitting the notice owns the copyright and believes their rights have been infringed upon. GitHub&#8217;s form also requires the submitter to assert that they have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.</p>
<p>Once the notice is submitted and once the provider confirms that the above things are done, they must &#8220;expeditiously&#8221; remove public access to the content. The DMCA does not define &#8220;expeditiously&#8221;.</p>
<p>The owner of the accused content then has the opportunity to file a counter-notice.  GitHub&#8217;s counter notice procedure is described in its <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">guide to submitting a DMCA counter notice</a>. This gives the person whose content has been removed recourse if they believe the original notice was invalid. A counter notice contains a statement by the user that the content was removed &#8220;as a result of mistake or misidentification&#8221;, signed under penalty of perjury. When a provider receives a counter notice, they must forward it to the original complainant, and restore the challenged material after 10-14 business days. At this point, if the complainant wishes to keep the material down, they must file a lawsuit against the alleged infringer.</p>
<p>By following these procedures as outlined by the DMCA, GitHub avoids liability to either party.</p>
<p>GitHub goes beyond what the DMCA law requires. All notices and counter notices that have ever been submitted to GitHub are published publicly in the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">github/dmca repository</a> (with personal information redacted). GitHub has also historically sided with developers in high profile infringement cases, such as the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">youtube-dl incident in 2020</a> (this incident involved a takedown relating to copyright circumvention, which is a different part of the DMCA law that I haven&#8217;t discussed here because it isn&#8217;t relevant to the notice that was sent to SymPy).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand, however, that GitHub&#8217;s hands are tied in many ways here. If they do not follow the notice and counter notice procedures exactly as outlined in the DMCA law, they risk losing their safe harbor status with the US Copyright Office. Were this to happen, it would be completely disastrous to GitHub as a business. Without safe harbor protection, GitHub could be liable for any copyrighted content that someone uploaded to its platform.</p>
<p>Finally, a technical note: when someone submits a takedown notice on a single part of a GitHub repository, GitHub&#8217;s response is to take down the entire repository. This is because it is technically impossible to remove only part of a repository due to the way git works. Completely scrubbing data from git history is possible, but it&#8217;s a destructive process that&#8217;s very disruptive to developers. Instead, GitHub requires the repository owners to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository">scrub the data themselves</a>, if they choose to, within one business day. Otherwise, they will take the entire repository down.</p>
<h2>What happened</h2>
<p>Below I provide a quick timeline of what happened. Times are in Mountain Daylight Time, which is where I live.</p>
<p>First, for background, the SymPy documentation website <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/">https://docs.sympy.org/</a> is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and mirrors the repository <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_doc">https://github.com/sympy/sympy_doc</a>. It is common for websites to be hosted on GitHub Pages because it&#8217;s completely free and easy to set up for someone who is already used to using git and GitHub. This <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/blog">blog itself</a> is hosted on GitHub Pages. The sympy_doc repository only contains the pre-built HTML of SymPy&#8217;s documentation. The actual source code lives in <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy">the main SymPy repository</a>. However, the DMCA claims were only ever made against the website, so the main SymPy source code repository was unaffected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Friday, Apr 15, 4:26 PM</strong>: Admins of the sympy/sympy_doc GitHub repository (myself, Ond&#345;ej &#268;ert&#237;k, and Oscar Benjamin) received an automated email from <a href="mailto:support@githubsupport.com">support@githubsupport.com</a> informing us that a DMCA takedown notice was filed against the SymPy documentation. Specifically, the claim, which can now be found on <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/04/2022-04-15-hackerrank.md">the github/dmca repository</a>, claimed that &#8220;Someone has illegally copied our client's technical exams questions and answers from their official website https://www.hackerrank.com/ and uploaded them on their platform without permission.&#8221; It specifically referenced the page <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solvers.html">https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solvers.html</a>. The notice was made on behalf of HackerRank by an individual from &#8220;WorthIT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.&#8221; The notice also stated &#8220;the infringing website is not willing to remove our client's work&#8221;, which came as a surprise to us since, at no point in time prior to receiving this notice had we received any communications from HackerRank or WorthIT Solutions.</p>
<p>The support email stated that if we do not remove the offending content within one business day, the repository, and consequently the docs website, will be taken down.</p>
<p>While it is not relevant to the legality of the situation, it is worth noting that this was on Good Friday and the upcoming Sunday, April 17, was Easter Sunday, which limited our ability to effectively respond over the weekend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Friday, April 15 - Tuesday, April 19</strong>: At first, we were not sure if the support email was legitimate or if it was just convincing spam. One thing that confused us was that the support email came from a domain, <a href="https://githubsupport.com/">githubsupport.com</a>, which did not appear to exist. Another issue is that although GitHub&#8217;s policy was to post all DMCA claims to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">the github/dmca repository</a>, this particular claim had not yet been uploaded there. We reached out to GitHub support to ask if the email was legitimate, and they responded Monday, April 18, 3:18 PM that the email was indeed a legitimate email from GitHub Trust &amp; Safety.</p>
<p>I had already reached out on Friday to <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> for assistance. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that represents many open source scientific projects including SymPy. However, due to the limited time frame of the notice and the fact that it occurred over a holiday weekend, NumFOCUS was not able to connect us with legal counsel until Tuesday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tuesday, April 19, 12:21 PM</strong>: We received notice from GitHub that the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_doc">sympy/sympy_doc</a> repository has been taken offline. The sympy/sympy_doc repository was replaced with a notice that the documentation was taken down by the DMCA notice with a link to the notice, which had been posted to the public github/dmca repository, and the documentation website itself started to 404. Since this was now public knowledge, we publicly announced this on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sympy/c/yuJXymiJqws">SymPy mailing list</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SymPy/status/1516534649970851841">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>We also worked with NumFOCUS and the legal counsel to send a counter notice to GitHub, since we believed that the notice was mistaken and that the claimed infringement, the code and mathematical examples on the docs page, were likely not even copyrightable.</p>
<p>Not long after the takedown occurred, someone posted it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31087175">to Hacker News</a>. The Hacker News posting eventually made its way to the front page and by the end of the day it had made its way to <a href="https://upvotetracker.com/post/hn/31087175">rank 3</a> on the site, where it received hundreds of upvotes and comments. The story also generated a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=hackerrank%20since%3A2022-04-19%20until%3A2022-04-20">buzz on Twitter</a> at this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tuesday, April 19, 6:40 PM</strong>: Vivek Ravisankar, the CEO of HackerRank, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31091354">posted a public apology on the Hacker News thread</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">Hello, I'm Vivek, founder/CEO of HackerRank. Our intention with this initiative is to takedown plagiarized code snippets or solutions to company assessments. This was definitely an unintended consequence. We are looking into it ASAP and also going to do an RCA to ensure this doesn't happen again.

Sorry, everyone!
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tuesday, April 19, 8:26 PM</strong>: Vivek posted a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31092085">followup comment on Hacker News</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">Hello again, Vivek, founder/CEO here. In the interest of moving swiftly, here are the actions we are going to take:
(1) We have withdrawn the DMCA notice for sympy; Sent a note to senior leadership in Github to act on this quickly.

(2) We have stopped the whole DMCA process for now and working on internal guidelines of what constitutes a real violation so that these kind of incidents don't happen. We are going to do this in-house

(3) We are going to donate $25k to the sympy project.

As a company we take a lot of pride in helping developers and it sucks to see this. I'm extremely sorry for what happened here.
</code></pre>
<p>HackerRank did follow through with the $25k donation to SymPy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wednesday, April 20, 12:00 AM (approximately)</strong>: The SymPy documentation website and the sympy/sympy_doc repository went back online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wednesday, April 20, 2022, 10:11 AM</strong>: We received an email notice from GitHub that the DMCA claim against our repository has been retracted. The <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/04/2022-04-19-hackerrank-retraction.md">retraction is made available online</a> on the github/dmca repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Views</h2>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve stated the facts, let me take a moment to give my own thoughts on this whole thing. My belief is that the DMCA claim that was made against the SymPy repository was completely baseless and without merit. Not only is no part of the SymPy documentation, to my knowledge, taken illegally from HackerRank or any other copyrighted source, but the claim itself was completely unspecific about which parts of the documentation were supposedly infringing. This made it impossible for us to comply even if the complaint was legitimate. In addition, it is questionable whether the supposed parts of the documentation that were taken from HackerRank, the mathematical and code examples, are even copyrightable. While this may not have been an actively targeted attack against SymPy, as a community run open source project, it served as one in practice.</p>
<p>We have never learned any more about which parts of the SymPy documentation were supposedly infringing on HackerRank&#8217;s copyright, and I expect we never will. Some people online have speculated that HackerRank actually took examples from the SymPy documentation, not the other way around, but I do not know if this is the case or not. It seems likely, given the large number of other <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/search?q=worthit">takedown notices WorthIT has made to GitHub on HackerRank&#8217;s behalf</a>, that they were using some sort of automated or semi-automated detection system, which somehow detected what it thought was infringing content on our website. I have personally never used the HackerRank platform, so I only know what sorts of things are on it from second-hand accounts.</p>
<p>Firstly let me say that if anyone or anything is to be blamed for this, my personal belief is that the blame should primarily lie on the DMCA law itself. While the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions of the law have been critical to the development of the modern internet, allowing social websites such as GitHub to exist without the burden of legal liability for user contributed content, other provisions are hostile to those same users, even those who are operating in a completely legal manner. The DMCA works in a &#8220;guilty until proven innocent&#8221; way, and the very operation of the takedown notice policy implicitly assumes that those making claims are not abusing the system as bad actors. It also incentivizes platforms such as GitHub to step aside and not take sides in claims, even claims such as this one, which refer to likely uncopyrightable material or are too unspecific to reasonably address even if they are legitimate.</p>
<p>The DMCA also has had further chilling effects due to its anti-circumvention provisions. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-16-years-under-dmca">EFF has written</a> extensively about these. While something as radical as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_abolition">abolishing copyright</a> may be considered to be practically untenable, I believe that laws like the DMCA can be rewritten so that they still serve their intended function of protecting copyright owners and providing &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; to websites like GitHub, while also protecting the rights of those accused of infringing copyright.</p>
<p>With that being said, I think some blame does need to lie on HackerRank and WorthIT Solutions for abusing the DMCA system and filing claims like this. They also lied in their claim when they said &#8220;the infringing website is not willing to remove our client's work.&#8221; At no point were we contacted by HackerRank or WorthIT Solutions about any copyright infringement. If we were, we would have been happy to work with them to determine whether any content in SymPy is infringing on copyright and remove it if it was. Even if it were the case that SymPy&#8217;s documentation infringed on HackerRank&#8217;s copyright, the immediate escalation to a DMCA takedown notice, which legally forced GitHub to completely disable the entire SymPy documentation, was completely inappropriate. Even submitting a counter notice is risky, because by doing so it increases the likelihood that the complaining party will bring an infringement lawsuit. Many DMCA&#8217;d repositories do not submit a counter notice for this reason, and we were only able to do so comfortably because we were able to do so via NumFOCUS. Had HackerRank not retracted the notice, we would have had to wait for our counter notice to take effect, meaning our docs website would have remained unavailable for 10-14 days. And had they instead taken down the main SymPy repository instead of the sympy_doc repo where the docs are hosted, this would have been a major disruption for our entire development workflow.</p>
<p>I do want to thank Vivek for quickly retracting the notice once this came to his attention, and I hope that he will be rethinking their DMCA policies at HackerRank, and for their donation to support SymPy and NumFOCUS.</p>
<p>Finally, while many have blamed GitHub, I believe that for the most part, they have acted as they are effectively required to by law. It is important to understand that any similar website based in the US would have likely treated this claim in a similar way. For instance, here is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/dmca/">GitLab&#8217;s DMCA policy</a>, which you can see is very similar to GitHub&#8217;s. By all accounts, GitHub is an industry leader here, by posting all notices and counter notices <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">online</a>, which they are not required to do, and by being very open about their DMCA policies (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy">[1]</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">[2]</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice">[3]</a>). With that being said, there are ways that GitHub&#8217;s processes could be improved here. The one business day that we were given to respond is actually standard in the industry, and ultimately comes from the &#8220;expeditiously&#8221; wording of the DMCA. But even so, if we were given more time than this, it would have made things much easier. It may have even been possible for us to reach out to HackerRank and resolve the situation before any actual takedown occurred. It also would be helpful if GitHub, while staying within the DMCA provisions, had a higher standard of legitimacy for takedown notices such as the one we received. As I have noted, the request we received was not nearly specific enough for us to effectively act on it, which should have been apparent to GitHub, since the only information WorthIT provided was a link to the HackerRank home page. Finally, I have two small technical requests from GitHub: first is to make <a href="https://githubsupport.com/">githubsupport.com</a> a real website so that support emails appear more legitimate, and second is to post DMCA notices to the DMCA repository right away rather than only after the repository is taken down, to make it clearer that the notices are in fact legitimate.</p>
<p>Open source communities such as SymPy are under-resourced and typically ill equipped to handle situations like these, which inherently puts them in an inferior position. This is despite the fact that open source software serves a global commons that benefits all. I have estimated that SymPy itself is used by hundreds of thousands of people, and the broader scientific Python ecosystem that it is part of is used by millions of people. Abuses of copyright law against these communities are harmful to society as a whole.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like to end with a few lessons that I&#8217;ve learned from this whole process.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take DMCA takedown notices seriously.</strong> If you ever receive a DMCA takedown notice from GitHub or any other website, you need to take it seriously. The website is required by law to remove your content after they receive such a notice. You can submit a counter notice, but this increases the likelihood of being sued.</li>
<li><strong>NumFOCUS fiscal sponsorship is invaluable.</strong> Our NumFOCUS fiscal sponsorship was invaluable here. Thanks to NumFOCUS, we were able to immediately access high quality legal advice on how to proceed here. Had HackerRank not retracted their notice, or even, heaven forbid, decided to sue, we would have had significant assistance and support from NumFOCUS. If you are part of an open source project that doesn&#8217;t have fiscal sponsorship, I would recommend looking into NumFOCUS, or other similar organizations. And if you want to <a href="https://numfocus.org/support">support NumFOCUS</a>, I encourage you to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Make backups of your online data.</strong> While the source code of any GitHub repository is effectively backed up onto every computer that has a git clone. Other data such as issues and pull request comments are not. We were lucky that the DMCA notice was sent against our documentation repository instead of our main repository. If our main repository were taken down instead, we would have lost access to all GitHub issue and pull request history. I have been looking into effective ways to backup this data. If anyone has any suggestions here, please let me know in the comments.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do feel that being on a site like GitHub is still preferable to something like self-hosting. If you self-host, you become responsible for a ton of things which GitHub does for you, like making sure everything stays online, handling servers, and managing spam. Also, self-hosting does not magically shield you from legal threats. If you self-host content that infringes on someone&#8217;s copyright, you are still legally liable for hosting that content.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone who supported SymPy during this incident. Even if you just talked about this on social media or upvoted the Hacker News story, that helped us get this into the public eye, which led to a much faster resolution than we expected. I especially want to thank Leah Silen and Arliss Collins from NumFOCUS; Ond&#345;ej &#268;ert&#237;k, Oscar Benjamin, and other SymPy community members; Pamela Chestek, the NumFOCUS legal counsel; and Travis Oliphant for the help they provided to us. Thank you to Thomas Dohmke, GitHub&#8217;s CEO, who we have reached out to privately, and who has promised to improve GitHub&#8217;s DMCA policies. I also want to thank Vivek Ravisankar from HackerRank for retracting the DMCA claim, and for the generous donation to SymPy.</p>
<p>Now that this incident is over, I&#8217;m hopeful we in the SymPy community can all go back to building software.</p>

						<div><p>I've ditched Disqus as the comment system on this blog. I am now using
<a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a>. Utterances is an open source comment
system that is backed by GitHub issues. Basically, every post has a
corresponding issue opened on GitHub, and the comments on the post are the
comments on the issue. Utterances automatically places the comments at the
bottom of the post. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/blog/issues/18">here</a> is the issue corresponding
to this post.</p>
<p>I didn't like Disqus mostly because it serves ads and tracking. Even though I
had opted out from as much of it as I could in the Disqus settings, it still
loads tracking scripts on every page. I run <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock
Origin</a> always, and it's a bit hypocritical
if my own side has things that are blocked by it. In some cases I can't avoid
it (as far as I know), like when I embed a YouTube video, but it definitely
shouldn't be on every post.</p>
<p>Utterances is a very nice alternative. I has lots of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments are not self-hosted. GitHub hosts them. Since you need a GitHub
account to comment, this should make comment spam a non-issue.</li>
<li>Comments support full Markdown.</li>
<li>Users can edit their comments.</li>
<li>I can edit and fully moderate all comments.</li>
<li>Users log in with a federated system that proves their identity.</li>
<li>Email subscription to posts.</li>
<li>No ads or tracking.</li>
<li>It's completely open source and free to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> like I do, it <a href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#comments">natively supports
Utterances</a> (a feature which I
added). Otherwise, go to the <a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a> and paste the
script tag generated at the bottom into your blog template. Then install the
<a href="https://github.com/apps/utterances">Utterances app</a> in your repo, and you are
done.</p>
<h3>Exporting Disqus Comments</h3>
<p>Some of my old posts had Disqus comments, which I wanted to preserve somehow.
Here is guide on how I did that, since it wasn't as straightforward as I would
have hoped.</p>
<p>The first step is to export your Disqus comments. It's very difficult to
actually find the place in the Disqus site where you do this, but I finally
found the <a href="https://disqus.com/admin/discussions/export/">URL</a>. The export takes
some time to complete (for me it took about half an hour). When it finished,
Disqus will email you an XML file with all your comments. Note that the file
contains all comments for all sites you have ever set up with Disqus. For me,
it also included all the comments on my old <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/">Wordpress
blog</a>, as well as posts for draft blog
posts that I never ended up publishing. It also contained all comments that
were marked as spam, so you will need to remember to filter those.</p>
<p>I decided that since I only have a handful of posts with Disqus comments, I
would just write a script to process them all and manually print them out,
which I will then manually enter in to the Utterances comment system for those
posts.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to process the comments, which you can find
<a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/blog/blob/master/disqus-comments/export_disqus_comments.py">here</a>.
Disqus does provides an <a href="https://disqus.com/api/schemas/1.0/disqus.xsd">XML
schema</a> for the XML. I used a
library called <a href="https://xsdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">xsData</a>,
which lets you take an XML scheme and generate Python dataclasses
corresponding to it, which make manipulating the parsed XML much easier than
the standard library xml library. The script outputs text like</p>

These are the original comments on this post that were made when this blog used the [Disqus blog system](https://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/switching-to-utterances-comments/).

&gt;**Comment from bjd2385 on 2016-08-28 12:33:12+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very interesting post. I was just looking into hash functions (I've never formally learned what the topic entails), and since I'm most familiar with Python this post explained quite a bit, especially your early mathematical points.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Comment from Mark Lawrence on 2016-10-03 20:26:54+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;At what point does Python 3 force the override of __hash__ if you've defined __eq__?  E.g when would your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AlwaysEqual class fail?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Replies:**

&gt;&gt;**Comment from asmeurer on 2016-10-03 20:38:13+00:00:**

&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a good catch. I originally wrote this post in Python 2. The example does indeed fail in Python 3. More specifically, if you override __eq__, Python 3 automatically sets __hash__ to None. I'll update the post to make this more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Comment from Erick Mendon&#231;a on 2017-07-30 03:23:55+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great article! We must really pay attention to these details when implementing custom hashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Comment from Ignacio on 2017-10-07 22:31:56+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for this post! Clarified a lot of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Note that to comment, there are two options. You can log in on this page,
which will let you type your comment in the box below. This requires giving
the Utterances bot access to your GitHub account. Alternately, if you don't
want to give a bot access, you can just go directly to the GitHub issue page
and comment there. I am currently in the process of figuring out how to add
some boilerplate to each page that makes this clear (see <a href="https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/355">this Utterances

suggestions on how to do this, let me know. For now, I am just going to
manually add a statement about this as the first comment on each post.</p></div>

						<p>This summer I had plenty of time during COVID-19 lockdown and I was looking at
<a href="https://sympygamma.com/">SymPy Gamma</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://iamit.in/assets/sympy-gamma-port/sympy_gamma_demo.gif" width="700" /></center>

<h2 id="sympy-gamma">Sympy Gamma</h2>

<p>SymPy Gamma is a web application that executes mathematical expressions
via natural language input from the user, after parsing them as SymPy
expressions it displays the result with additional related computations.
It is inspired from the idea of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a> which is based on the
commercial Computer Algebra System named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica">&#8220;Mathematica&#8221;</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://iamit.in/assets/misc/wolfram-alpha-logo.svg" width="300" /></center>

<p>I have always been impressed by it ever since I first found about it.
While playing with it during this summer, I realised that it runs on Google
App Engine&#8217;s Python 2.7 runtime. It is powered by SymPy, an open source
computer algebra system.</p>

<center><img align="center" src="https://iamit.in/assets/misc/Sympy_logo.svg" width="150" /></center>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Despite being widely used around the world (about ~14K users everyday,
as seen from Google Analytics), there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of development
in the past 5 years. Due to this the current infrastructure
was stuck on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine">Google App Engine</a>&#8217;s Python 2 runtime which obviously does
not support Python 3.</p>

<p>This also prevented it to use the latest version of SymPy. The SymPy
version (~0.7.6) it was using was last updated 6 years ago. This made
SymPy Gamma in urgent need for upgradation. At the time of writing this blog,
SymPy Gamma is running on Google App Engine&#8217;s latest runtime and latest
version of SymPy.</p>

<h2 id="solution-and-process">Solution and Process</h2>

<p>It was a fun project and was interesting to see how Google cloud offering has evolved
from Google App Engine to Google Cloud Platform. The old App engine did
seem like a minimal cloud offering launched by Google in an attempt to
ship something early and quickly. It reminded me of my first cloud project
in college (<a href="https://github.com/aktech/dturmscrap">dturmscrap</a>), which I
deployed to Google App Engine, back in 2015.</p>

<p>I used Github projects to track the whole project, all the work done for this
can be seen <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="-git-log">$ Git Log</h2>

<p>Here is a summary of what was achieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/135">PR 135</a>: Migrating Django to a slightly higher version,
this was the first blood just to make sure everything was working. I upgraded it to the latest version of
Django that was supported on Python 2 runtime. This also exposed the broken CI, which was fixed in this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/137">PR 137</a>: This upgraded the CI infrastructure to use Google Cloud SDK
for deployment, the previous method was discontinued.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/140">PR 140</a>: Upgrading the Database backend to use Cloud NDB instead
of the legacy App Engine NDB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/148">PR 148</a>: Since we change the database backend, we needed something for
testing locally, this was done by using Google Cloud Datastore emulator locally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/149">PR 149</a>: The installation and setup of the project was quite a challenge.
Installing and keeping track of the versions of a number of application was non-trivial. This Pull request dockerized
the project and made the development setup trivial and it all boiled down to just one command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/152">PR 152</a>: The login feature was previously implemented using the user API
of the Google App Engine&#8217;s Python2 runtime, which was not available in Python 3 runtime. We removed the login feature as it
was not used by many and was too much effort to setup OAuth for login.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/153">PR 153</a>: Now was the time to slowly move towards Python 3 by making the
code compatible with both 2 and 3. It was achieved via <a href="https://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-modernize</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/154">PR 154</a>: We then made the migration to Python 3.7 runtime and removed submodules
and introduced a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code> for installing dependencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/154">PR 159</a>: The above change made it possible to upgrade SymPy to latest version,
which was 1.6 at that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/154">PR 165</a>: The last piece of the puzzle was upgrading Django itself, so we upgraded
it to the latest version, which was Django 3.0.8.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h4>

<ul>
  <li>At the time of writing this Google has released the Python 3.8 runtime, it would nice to further upgrade it now.</li>
  <li>The test coverage can be increased.</li>
  <li>The code can be refactored to be more readable and approachable for new contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Google for properly <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/migrate-to-python3">documenting the process</a>,
which made the transition much easier.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFocus</a>, without them this project would not have been possible. Also thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/certik">Ondrej Certik</a> and <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer">Aaron Meurer</a> for their advice and support
throughout the project.</p>

						<p>This report summarizes the work done in my GSoC 2020 project, <strong>Implementation of Vector Integration</strong> with SymPy.  Blog posts with step by step development of the project are available at <a href="https://friyaz.github.io">friyaz.github.io</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am Faisal Riyaz and I have completed my third year of B.Tech in Computer Engineering student from Aligarh Muslim University.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of the project is to add functions and class structure to support the integration of scalar and vector fields over curves, surfaces, and volumes. My mentors were <a href="https://github.com/Upabjojr">Francesco Bonazzi</a> (Primary) and <a href="https://github.com/divyanshu132">Divyanshu Thakur</a>.</p>

<p>In many cases, it is difficult to determine the parametric representation of a region. Instead, the region is defined using its implicit equation. To represent implicitly defined regions, we implemented the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitRegion</code> class.</p>

<p>But to integrate over a region, we need to determine its parametric representation. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rationl_parametrization</code>  method was added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitRegion</code>.</p>

<p>After PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19883">#19883</a> gets merged, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector_integrate</code> can directly work upon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitRegion</code> objects.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In vector calculus, many regions cannot be defined using a single implicit equation. Instead, inequality or a combination of the implicit equation and conditional equations is required. For Example, a disc can only be represented using an inequality <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitRegion(x**2 + y**2 &lt; 9)</code> and a semicircle can be represented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitRegion(x**2 + y**2 -4) &amp; (y &lt; 0))</code>. Support for such implicit regions needs to be added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parametrization obtained using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rational_parametrization</code> method in most cases is a large expression. SymPy&#8217;s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Integral</code> is unable to work over such expressions. It takes too long and often does not returns a result. We need to either simplify the parametric equations obtained or fix Integral to handle them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adding the support to plot objects of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParamRegion</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitRegion</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This summer has been a great learning experience. Writing a functionality, testing, debugging it has given me good experience in test-driven development. I think I realized many of the goals that I described in my proposal, though there were some major differences in the plan and actual implementation. Personally, I hoped I could have done better. I could not work much on the project during the last phase due to the start of the academic year.</p>

<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/Upabjojr">Francesco</a> for his valuable suggestions and being readily available for discussions. He was always very friendly and helpful. I would love to work more with him. <a href="https://github.com/sylee957">S.Y Lee</a> also provided useful suggestions.</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://risc.jku.at/m/johann-mitteramskogler/">Johann Mitteramskogler</a>, Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=IAz1bNgAAAAJ&amp;hl=es">Sonia Perez Diaz</a>, and Professor <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/87/7718.html">Sonia L.Rueda</a>. They personally helped me in finding the algorithm for determining the rational parametrization of conics.</p>

<p>SymPy is an amazing project with a great community. I would mostly stick around after the GSoC period as well and continue contributing to SymPy, hopefully, exploring the other modules as well.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This summer has been a great learning experience and has helped me get a good exposure of test-driven development. I plan to continue contributing to SymPy and will also try to help the new contributors. I am grateful to my mentors, <a href="https://github.com/jksuom">Kalevi Suominen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leosartaj">Sartaj Singh</a> for reviewing my work, giving me valuable suggestions, and being readily available for discussions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This was a long pending issue. It was necessary to refactor the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_nseries</code> method of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code> to fix some minor issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This marks the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phase-3</code> of the program.
Finally, this brings us to the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Google Summer of Code</code> and I am really thankful to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code> Community and my mentor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kalevi Suominen</code> for always helping and supporting me.</p>

						<p>Key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlights</code> of this week&#8217;s work are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/18656">Implemented Raabe&#8217;s Test</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>This was a long pending issue. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Raabe's Test</code> helps to determine the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">convergence</code> of a series. It has been added to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concrete</code> module to handle those cases when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ratio test</code> becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inconclusive</code>.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19990">Fixed limit evaluations related to lowergamma, uppergamma and besselk function</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>We added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_is_meromorphic</code> method to class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code> so that some of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limits</code> involving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code> functions 
get evaluated using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meromorphic check</code> already present in the limit codebase. Now, to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code> functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tractable</code> for limit evaluations, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_aseries</code> method was added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_rewrite_as_tractable</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code>.</p>

        <p>Finally, we also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rectified</code> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval</code> method of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">besselk</code>, so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">besselk(nu, oo)</code> automatically evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

      <li>This was a long pending issue. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_peeloff_pi</code> method of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sin</code> had to be rectified to reduce the symbolic multiples of pi in trigonometric functions.

      <li>In this PR, we added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_nseries</code> method to both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sin</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cos</code> to make the limit evaluations more robust when it comes to trigonometric functions.
We also added a piece of code to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cos.eval</code> method so that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limit of cos(m*x)</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">non-zero</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> tends to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oo</code> evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AccumBounds(-1, 1)</code>.</li>

						<p>This week, I spent most of my time reading about algorithms to parametrize algebraic curves and surfaces.</p>

<h3 id="parametrization-of-algebraic-curves-and-surfaces">Parametrization of algebraic curves and surfaces</h3>
<p>In many cases, it is easiar to define a region using an implicit equation over its parametric form. For example, a sphere can be defined with the implict eqution x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 4. Its parametric equation although easy to determine are tedious to write.</p>

<p>To integrate over implicitly defined regions, it is necessary to determine its parametric representation. I found the <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348a-20-winter/Handouts/a228715.pdf">report</a> on conversion methods between parametric and implicit curves from Christopher M. Hoffmann very useful. It lists several algorithms for curves and surfaces of different nature.</p>

<p>Every plane parametric curve can be expressed as an implicit curve. Some, but not all implicit curves can be expressed as parametric curves. Similarly, we can state of algebraic surfaces. Every plane parametric surface can be expressed as an implicit surface. Some, but not all implicit surfaces can be expressed as parametric surfaces.</p>

<h3 id="conic-sections">Conic sections</h3>
<p>One of the algorithm to parametrize conics is given below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fix a point p on the conic. Consider the pencil of lines through p. Formulate the line equations.</li>
  <li>Substitute for y in the conic equation, solve for x(t).</li>
  <li>Use the fine equations to determine y(t).</li>
</ol>

<p>The difficult part is to find a point on the conic. For the first implementation, I just iterated over a few points and selected the point which satisfied the equation. I need to implement an algorithm that can find a point on the curve.</p>

<p>The parametric equations determined by the algoithm are large and complex expressions. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector_integrate</code> function in most cases is taking too much time to calculate the integral. I tried fixing this using simplification functions in SymPy like trigsimp and expand_trig. The problem still persist.</p>

<span class="c1">### It gets stuck
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The algorithm does not work for curves of higher algebraic degree like cubics.</p>

<h3 id="monoids">Monoids</h3>
<p>A monoid is an algebraic curve of degree n that has a point of multiplicity n -1. All conics and singular cubics are monoids. Parametrizing a monoid is easy if the special point is known.</p>

<p>To parametrize a monoid, we need to determine a singular point of n - 1 multiplicity. The singular points are those points on the curve where both partial derivatives vanish. A singular point (xo, yo) of a Curve C is said to be of multiplicity n if all the partial derivatives off to order n - 1 vanish there. This <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Singular-Points-of-Algebraic-Curves-Sakkalis-Farouki/2f8a3e9620c8a5c754f8baaf297af3eff1e6b1f1">paper</a> describes an algorithm to calculate such a point but the algorithm is not trivial.</p>

<h3 id="next-weeks-goal">Next week&#8217;s goal</h3>
<p>My goal is to complete the work on parametrizing conics. If I can find a simple algorithm to determine the singular point of the required multiplicity, I will start working on it.</p>

						<p>My goal for this week was to add support of integration over objects of geometry module.</p>

<h3 id="integrating-over-objects-of-geometry-module">Integrating over objects of geometry module</h3>
<p>In my GSoC proposal, I mentioned implementing classes to represent commonly used regions. It will allow a user to easily define regions without bothering about its parametric representation. SymPy&#8217;s geometry module has classes to represent commonly used geometric entities like line, circle, and parabola. Francesco told me it would be better to add support to use these classes instead. The integral takes place over the boundary of the geometric entity, not over the area or volume enclosed.</p>

<p>My first approach was to add a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parametric_region</code> to the classes of geometry module. Francesco suggested not to modify the geometry module as this would make it dependent on vector module. We decided to implement a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parametric_region</code> to return a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricRegion</code> of objects of geometry module.</p>

<p>I learned about the singledispatch decorater of python. It is used to create overloaded functions.<br />
Polygons cannot be represented as a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricRegion</code> object. Each side of a polygon has its separate parametric representation. To resolve this, we decided to return a list of ParametricRegion objects.</p>

<p>My next step was to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector_integrate</code> to support objects of geometry module. This was easy and involved calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parametric_region_list</code> function and integrating each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricRegion</code> object.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19650/files">PR</a> for the work has been merged. Note that we still do not have any way to create regions like disc and cone without their parametric representation. To support such regions, I think we need to add new classes to the geometry module.</p>

<h3 id="next-weeks-goal">Next week&#8217;s goal</h3>
<p>I plan to work on implementing a class to represent implicitly defined regions.</p>

						<p>The first phase of GSoC is over. We can now integrate the scalar or vector field over a parametrically defined region.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19539">PR</a> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> class has been merged. In my <a href="https://friyaz.github.io/blog/GSoC-2020-Week-3">last post</a>, I mentioned about a weird error. It turns out that I was importing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pi</code> as a symbol instead of as a number. Due to this, the expressions were returned unevaluated causing tests to fail.</p>

<h2 id="the-route-ahead">The route ahead</h2>
<p>I had a detailed discussion with Francesco about the route ahead. My plan has drifted from my proposal because we have decided not to implement new classes for special regions like circles and spheres. The geometry module already has classes to represent some of these regions. We have decided to use these classes.</p>

<p>Francesco reminded me that we have to complete the documentation of these changes. I was planning to complete the documentation in the last phase. But I will try completing it soon as I may forget some details.</p>

<p>We also discussed adding support to perform integral transformation using Stoke&#8217;s and Green&#8217;s theorem. In many cases, such transformation can be useful but adding them may be outside the scope of this project.</p>

<p>I have convinced Francesco on adding classes to represent implicitly defined regions. It might be the most difficult part of the project but hopefully, it will be useful to SymPy users.</p>
<h3 id="next-weeks-goal">Next week&#8217;s goal</h3>
<p>My next week&#8217;s goal is to make a PR for adding suppor to integrate over objects of the geometry module.</p>

						<p>Key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlights</code> of this week&#8217;s work are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19716">Fixed incorrect limit evaluation related to LambertW function</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>This was a minor bug fix. We added the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_singularities</code> feature to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LambertW</code> function so that its limit gets evaluated using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meromorphic check</code> already present in the limit codebase.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/18696">Fixed errors in assumptions when rewriting RisingFactorial / FallingFactorial as gamma or factorial</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a long pending issue. The rewrite to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gamma</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">factorial</code> methods of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RisingFactorial</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FallingFactorial</code> did not handle all the possible cases, which caused errors in some evaluations.
Thus, we decided to come up with a proper rewrite using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Piecewise</code> which accordingly returned the correct rewrite depending on the assumptions on the variables.
Handling such rewrites using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Piecewise</code> is never easy, and thus there were a lot of failing testcases.
After spending a lot of time debugging and fixing each failing testcase, we were finally able to merge this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This marks the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phase-2</code> of the program. I learnt a lot during these two months and gained many important things from my mentors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19680">Improved the limit evaluations of Power objects</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This PR improves the limit evaluations of Power objects.
We first check if the limit expression is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Power object</code> and then accordingly evaluate the limit depending on different cases.
First of all, we express <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b**e</code> in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exp(e*log(b))</code>. After this, we check if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e*log(b)</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meromorphic</code> and accordingly evaluate the final result.
This check helps us to handle the trivial cases in the beginning itself.</p>

        <p>Now, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e*log(b)</code> is not meromorphic, then we separately evaluate the limit of the base and the exponent.
This helps us to determine the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">indeterminant form</code> of the limit expression if present. 
As we know, there are 3 indeterminate forms corresponding to power objects: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0**0</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oo**0</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1**oo</code>, which need to be handled carefully.
If there is no indeterminate form present, then no further evaluations are required. Otherwise, we handle all the three cases separately and correctly evaluate the final result.</p>

        <p>We also added some code to improve the evaluation of limits having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abs()</code> expressions.
For every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abs()</code> term present in the limit expression, we replace it simply by its argument or the negative of its argument, depending on
whether the value of the limit of the argument is greater than zero or less than zero for the given limit variable.</p>

        <p>Finally, we were able to merge this after resolving some failing testcases.

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19697">Fixed limit evaluations involving error functions</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The incorrect limit evaluations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error functions</code> were mainly because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tractable</code> rewrite was wrong and did not handle all the possible cases.
For a proper rewrite, it was required that the limit variable be passed to the corresponding rewrite method.
This is because, to define a correct rewrite we had to evaluate the limit of the argument of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error function</code>, for the passed limit variable.
Thus, we added a default argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limitvar</code> to all the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tractable rewrite</code> methods and resolved this issue.
While debugging, we also noticed that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_as_leading_term</code> method of error function was wrong, hence it was also fixed.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19646">Fixed RecursionError and Timeout in limit evaluations</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Recursion Errors</code> in limit evaluations were mainly due to the fact that the indeterminant form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1**oo</code> was not handled accurately in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mrv()</code> function of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gruntz algorithm</code>. So, some minor changes were required to fix those.</p>

        <p>The major issue was to handle those cases which were timing out. On deep digging, we identified that the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel()</code> function of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polytools.py</code> was the reason. Thus, we decided to completely transform the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel()</code> function to speed up its algorithm. 
Now after this major modification, many testcases were failing as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel()</code> function plays an important role in simplifying evaluations and 
is thus used at many places across the codebase. Therefore, a lot of time was spent in debugging and rectifying these testcases.</p>

        <p>Finally we were able to merge this, enhancing the limit evaluation capabilities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code>.</p>

						<p>I spent this week working on the implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> class.</p>

<h3 id="modifying-api-of-parametricregion">Modifying API of ParametricRegion</h3>
<p>When I was writing the test cases, I realized that the API of the ParametricRegion could be improved. Instead of passing limits as a dictionary, tuples can be used. 
So I modified the API of the ParametricRegion class. The new API is closer to the API of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">integral</code> class and more intuitive.  I made a separate <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19580">PR</a> for this change to make it easy for reviewers.</p>

<p>Example of the new API:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParametricRegion</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="handling-scalar-fields-with-no-base-scalars">Handling scalar fields with no base scalars</h3>
<p>As discussed in previous posts, we decided to not associate a coordinate system with the parametric region. Instead, we assume that the parametricregion is defined in the coordinate system of the field of which the integral is being calculated. We calculate the position vector and normal vector of the parametric region using the base scalars and vectors of the fields. This works fine for most cases. But when the field does not contain any base scalar or vector in its expression, we cannot extract the coordinate system from the field.</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParametricIntegral</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">150</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># We cannot determine the coordinate system from the field. 
# To calculate the line integral, we need to find the derivative of the position vector.
# This is not possible until we know the base vector of the field
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>To handle this situation, I assign a coordinate system C to the region. This does not affect the result in any way as the result is independent of it. It just allows the existing algorithm to work in this case.</p>

<h3 id="separate-class-for-vector-and-scalar-fields">Separate class for vector and scalar fields</h3>
<p>Francesco suggested making separate classes based on the nature of the field: vector and scalar. I am open to this idea. But I think it will be more easy and intuitive for the users if they can use the same class to calculate the integral. I do not think they are different enough from a user&#8217;s perspective to have a separate interface.</p>

<p>Maybe we can have a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vectorintegrate</code> which returns the object of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricVectorIntegral</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricScalarIntegral</code> depending on the nature of the field. This can work for other types of integrals too. Suppose we implement a class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitIntegral</code> to calculate the integral over an implicit region. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vectorintegrate</code> function can then return an object of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImplicitIntegral</code> object by identifying the region is defined implicitly. I think this will be great. I will have more discussion with Francesco on this aspect.</p>

<h3 id="topological-sort-of-parameters">Topological sort of parameters</h3>
<p>When evaluating double integral, the result some times depend upon the order in which the integral is evaluated. If the bounds of one parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> depend on another parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code>, we should integrate first with respect to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code>.</p>

<p>For example, consider the problem of evaluating the area of the triangle.</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">T</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParametricRegion</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The area of the triangle is 10 units and should be independent of the order parameters are specified at the time of object initialization. But the double integral depends on the order of integration.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; integrate(1, (x, 0, 2), (y, 10 - 5*x))
20 - 10*x
&gt;&gt;&gt; integrate(1, (y, 0, 10 - 5*x), (x, 0, 2))
10
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So parameters must be passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">integrate</code> in the correct order. To overcome this issue, we topologically sort the parameters. SymPy already had a function to perform topologically sort in its utilities module. I implemented a function that generates the graph and passes it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">topological_sort</code> function. This made my work easy.</p>

<h3 id="long-computation-time-of-integrals">Long computation time of Integrals</h3>
<p>Some integrals are taking too long to compute. When base scalars in the field are replaced by their parametric equivalents, the expression of the field becomes large. Further, the integrand is the dot product of the field with a vector or product of the field and the magnitude of the vector. The integrate function takes about 20-30 seconds to calculate the integral. I think this behavior is due to the expression of integrand growing structurally despite it being simple.</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;solidsphere = ParametricRegion((r*sin(phi)*cos(theta), r*sin(phi)*sin(theta), r*cos(phi)),\
                                (r, 0, 2), (theta, 0, 2*pi), (phi, 0, pi))
&gt;&gt;&gt; ParametricIntegral(C.x**2 + C.y**2, solidsphere)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this case, the parametric field when replaced with parametersr become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r**2*sin(phi)**2*sin(theta)**2 + r**2*sin(phi)**2*cos(theta)**2</code> although it can be easily simplified to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r**2*sin(phi)</code>.</p>

<p>SymPy has a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simplify</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simplify</code> attempts to apply various methods to simplify an expression. When the integrand is simplified using it before passing to integrate, the result is returned almost immediately. Francesco rightly pointed out that simplify is computationally expensive and we can try to some specific simplification. I will look into it.</p>

<h3 id="failing-test-cases">Failing test cases</h3>
<p>Some test cases are failing because of integrate function returning results in different forms. The results are mathematically equivalent but different in terms of structure. I found this strange. I do not think this has to do with hashing. I still have not figured out this problem.</p>

<h3 id="next-weeks-goal">Next week&#8217;s goal</h3>
<p>Hopefully, I will complete the work on the ParamatricIntegral and get it merged. We can then start discussing about representing implicit regions.</p>

						<p>Part of this week was spent in getting the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19472">PR</a> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricRegion</code> merged. I made some fixes to get the failing tests to pass. I also added the docstring.</p>

<h3 id="parametricintegral">ParametricIntegral</h3>
<p>I started <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19539">working</a> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> class. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> class returns the integral of a scalar or vector field over a region defined parametrically. It should be able to calculate line, surface, or volume integral depending on the nature of the parametric region. To identify the nature of the region, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dimensions</code> property needs to be added in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricRegion</code> class.</p>

<p>I started with writing the test cases to avoid my previous mistake of working on the implementation before deciding the API. 
The API of the ParametricIntegral class:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParametricIntegral</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">field</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">parametricregion</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>I initially thought to make it a subclass of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Integral</code> as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> is a kind of integral. But there was no reuse of any code from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Integral</code> in the    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> so decided against it.<br />
A rough sketch of the algorithm to calculate integral is described below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Replace the base scalars in the field with their definition in terms of parameters and obtain the parametric representation of the field.</li>
  <li>Form the position vector of the region using definition tuple and base vectors determined from the field.</li>
  <li>Depending on the type of region, calculate the derivative of the position vector, or find the normal vector or calculate dV using Jacobian.</li>
  <li>Calculate the integrand using dot product or multiplication with the parametric field.</li>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">integrate</code> function to calculate the integral.</li>
  <li>If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">integrate</code> function can evaluate the integral, return it otherwise return an object of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricRegion</code> class.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also had <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/19320#issuecomment-643234256">discussion</a> on whether swapping the upper and lower limit has any affect on the result of a vector integral. For multiple integrals, the sign of the result changes when the upper and lower bound of a parameter are interchanged. I do not think we came to any conclusion. But this won&#8217;t matter for integrals over parametric regions as the bounds are directly defined by the user.</p>

<h3 id="next-weeks-goal">Next week&#8217;s goal</h3>
<p>I will start working on the implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ParametricIntegral</code> class. I am also trying to get more involved in SymPy outside of my GSoC project. I hope I can become a contributing member of the community.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19555">Adds cdir parameter to handle series expansions on branch cuts</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, after spending almost 2 weeks on this, we were able to merge the PR, adding a very important functionality of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series expansions</code> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch cuts</code> to the codebase. 
Previously, either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code> raised some error or the series expansion was computed incorrectly, when the value in the input was on the branch cut. But now, for most of the functions, the expansion produced is correct.</p>

        <p>Not only this, we added the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cdir</code> parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leadterm</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as_leading_term</code> functions as well. We even extended the functionality a bit to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limits</code> module, so now, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limits</code> of values lying on the branch cuts of a function are also computed correctly in most cases.</p>

        <p>We are planning to extend this functionality to all the remaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">special functions</code> and wherever else possible to make the codebase even more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robust</code>.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19515">Fixed incorrect evaluation caused due to subfactorial in limit_seq expression</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>This was a minor bug fix. 
The functionality of rewriting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subfactorial</code> term present in an expression into an equivalent term expressed in 
the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">factorial</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gamma</code> was added which helped resolve the issue.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19555">Adds cdir parameter to handle series expansions on branch cuts</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Currently, many functions in the codebase are unable to produce correct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series expansions</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch cuts</code>. As a result,
the limit evaluation takes place incorrectly for these functions when the limiting value lies on the branch cuts.</p>

        <p>Thus, we have decided to come up with a parameter named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cdir</code> which stands for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complex direction</code> and it indicates the direction from which the series expansion is required, thus helping us
to produce the correct series expansion. Special care needs to be taken while handling series expansions on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch points</code>.</p>

        <p>Once we are finished with this work, it will be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">major enhancement</code> to the limit evaluation and series expansion capabilities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This marks the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phase-1</code> of the program. I learnt a lot during this one month and gained many important things from my mentors.</p>

						<p>The first week of GSoC has been completed. My goal for this week was to add ParametricRegion class. Many common regions have well known parametric representation. Calculation of Integrals on parametric regions is a common problem of vector calculus.</p>

<p>The PR for adding the ParametricRegion class is <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19472">#19472</a>.</p>

<h1 id="parametricregion">ParametricRegion</h1>
<p>An object of ParametricRegion class represents a region in space defined in terms of parameters. If a user wants to perform integration on a region, they have to create a ParametricRegion object. This object can then be passed to other classes to perform integration.</p>

<p>The implementation part was easy. The difficulty was in deciding the API. I spent much of the week discussing the API, But it was worth it. The ParametricRegion class will most likely be used by many users so it is important for it to be simple and intuitive. I think I should have first completed writing test cases and examples.</p>

<p>The final <strong>API</strong> of ParametricRegion class:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ParametricRegion</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parameters_or_coordsys</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">definition</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">limits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some <strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>p = ParametricRegion(t, (t, t**3), limits={t: (1, 2)})
halfdisc = ParametricRegion((r, theta), (r*cos(theta), r* sin(theta)), {r: (-2, 2), theta: (0, pi)})
cylinder = ParametricRegion((r, theta, z), (cos(theta), r*sin(theta), C.z), {theta: (0, 2*pi), z: (0, 4)})
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="parameters_or_coordsys">parameters_or_coordsys</h3>
<p>This argument specifies the parameters of the parametric region. When there are more than one parameter, the user has to pass them as tuple. When a CoordSys3d object is passed, its base scalars are used as parameters.</p>

<h3 id="definition">definition</h3>
<p>definiton tuple maps the base scalars to thier parametric representation. It is not necessary for evey base scalar to have a parametric definition.</p>

<h3 id="coordsys3d">CoordSys3D</h3>
<p>A parametric representation is just defining base scalars in terms of some parameters. If the base scalars are not knowm, the region cannot be completely specified. My intial approach was to include an argument to specify the coordinate system.</p>

<p>Passing a CoordSys3D object can be non intuitive for users. In most cases, the base scalars of the parametric region are the same as that of vector/scalar field. We can avoid passing the CoordSys3D object if we assume that the base scalars of parametric region field are same.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParametricRegion</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">theta</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">cos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">theta</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">sin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">theta</span><span class="p">)),</span> <span class="n">limits</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">r</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">theta</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pi</span><span class="p">)})</span>
<span class="n">Integral</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># C.x = r*cos(theta),  C.y = r*sin(theta), C.z = C.z
</span><span class="n">Integral</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">R</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">R</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># R.x = r*cos(theta),  R.y = r*sin(theta), R.z = R.z
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>There can be a situation where SymPy cannot determine the coordinate system of the field. In such situations, we can raise a ValueError. For example:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Integral</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="limits">limits</h3>
<p>Most parametric region have bounds on the parameters. Note that it is not necessary for every parameter to have an upper and lower bound.</p>

<p>There can be many methods for a user to define bounds of parametric region. We decied to use a dictionary which we named limits. The keys of the dictionary are parameters and the values are tuples (lower bound, upper bound). Another approach is to use a nested bound tuple. Every subtuple will represent the bounds of a parameter.</p>

<h3 id="next-weeks-goal">Next week&#8217;s goal</h3>
<p>My next week&#8217;s task is to get started with ParametricIntegral class. This class will represent integral of a scalar/vector field on a parametric surface. I will first write the unit tests and examples.</p>

                    <p>If you are a SymPy contributor you can have your blog on Planet SymPy. Blog content can be SymPy/SymEngine/SciPy/Python themed, English language and not liable to offend. If you have a general blog you may want to set up a tag and subscribe the feed for that tag only to Planet SymPy.</p>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is kept in GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy">here</a>. If you have an account you can add or edit your own feed: </p>

                        <li>Put your hackergotchi in <em>website/hackergotchi/</em>. A hackergotchi should be a photo of your face smaller than 80x80 pixels with a transparent background. <em>git add</em> the file.</li>

                        <li>At the end of the <em>planetsympy/config</em> file add your details (the name in brackets is your GitHub handle):</li>

                    <p>If you do not have a GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy/issues/new">file an issue in the issue tracker</a> listing your name, GitHub account (if you have one), RSS or Atom feed. Attach a photo of your face for hackergotchi.</p>

                    <h2>Planet SymPy Guidelines</h2>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is one of the public faces of the SymPy project and is read by many users and potential contributors. The content aggregated at Planet SymPy is the opinions of its authors, but the sum of that content gives an impression of the project. Please keep in mind the following guidelines for your blog content and read the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">SymPy Code of Conduct</a>. The SymPy project reserves the right to remove an inappropriate blog from the Planet.</p>

                    <h3>Blogs should be SymPy themed</h3>

                    <p>The majority of content in your blog should be about SymPy and your work on SymPy. The blog can also be about anything that interests SymPy community, for example, scientific computing, language syntax and semantics, etc. Blog posts about personal subjects are also encouraged since Planet SymPy is a chance to learn more about the developers behind SymPy. However blog feeds should not be entirely personal, if in doubt set up a tag for Planet SymPy and subscribe the feed from that tag so you can control what gets posted.</p>

                    <h3>Posts should be constructive</h3>

                    <p>Posts can be positive and promote SymPy, they can be constructive and lay out issues which need to be addressed, but blog feeds should not contain useless, destructive and negative material. Constructive criticism is welcome and the occasional rant is understandable, but a feed where every post is critical and negative is unsuitable. This helps to keep SymPy overall a happy project.</p>

                    <h3>You must be a SymPy contributor</h3>

                    <p>Only have your blog on Planet SymPy if you actively contribute to SymPy, for example through code, user support, documentation etc.</p>

                    <h3>It must be a personal blog, or in a blog class</h3>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is a collection of blogs from SymPy contributors.</p>

                    <h3>Do not inflame</h3>

                    <p>SymPy covers a wide variety of people and cultures. Profanities, prejudice, lewd comments and content likely to offend are to be avoided. Do not make personal attacks or attacks against other projects on your blog.</p>
