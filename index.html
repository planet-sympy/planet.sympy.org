						<div><p>I've ditched Disqus as the comment system on this blog. I am now using
<a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a>. Utterances is an open source comment
system that is backed by GitHub issues. Basically, every post has a
corresponding issue opened on GitHub, and the comments on the post are the
comments on the issue. Utterances automatically places the comments at the
bottom of the post. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/blog/issues/18">here</a> is the issue corresponding
to this post.</p>
<p>I didn't like Disqus mostly because it serves ads and tracking. Even though I
had opted out from as much of it as I could in the Disqus settings, it still
loads tracking scripts on every page. I run <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock
Origin</a> always, and it's a bit hypocritical
if my own side has things that are blocked by it. In some cases I can't avoid
it (as far as I know), like when I embed a YouTube video, but it definitely
shouldn't be on every post.</p>
<p>Utterances is a very nice alternative. I has lots of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments are not self-hosted. GitHub hosts them. Since you need a GitHub
account to comment, this should make comment spam a non-issue.</li>
<li>Comments support full Markdown.</li>
<li>Users can edit their comments.</li>
<li>I can edit and fully moderate all comments.</li>
<li>Users log in with a federated system that proves their identity.</li>
<li>Email subscription to posts.</li>
<li>No ads or tracking.</li>
<li>It's completely open source and free to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> like I do, it <a href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#comments">natively supports
Utterances</a> (a feature which I
added). Otherwise, go to the <a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a> and paste the
script tag generated at the bottom into your blog template. Then install the
<a href="https://github.com/apps/utterances">Utterances app</a> in your repo, and you are
done.</p>
<h3>Exporting Disqus Comments</h3>
<p>Some of my old posts had Disqus comments, which I wanted to preserve somehow.
Here is guide on how I did that, since it wasn't as straightforward as I would
have hoped.</p>
<p>The first step is to export your Disqus comments. It's very difficult to
actually find the place in the Disqus site where you do this, but I finally
found the <a href="https://disqus.com/admin/discussions/export/">URL</a>. The export takes
some time to complete (for me it took about half an hour). When it finished,
Disqus will email you an XML file with all your comments. Note that the file
contains all comments for all sites you have ever set up with Disqus. For me,
it also included all the comments on my old <a href="http://asmeurersympy.wordpress.com/">Wordpress
blog</a>, as well as posts for draft blog
posts that I never ended up publishing. It also contained all comments that
were marked as spam, so you will need to remember to filter those.</p>
<p>I decided that since I only have a handful of posts with Disqus comments, I
would just write a script to process them all and manually print them out,
which I will then manually enter in to the Utterances comment system for those
posts.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to process the comments, which you can find
<a href="https://github.com/asmeurer/blog/blob/master/disqus-comments/export_disqus_comments.py">here</a>.
Disqus does provides an <a href="https://disqus.com/api/schemas/1.0/disqus.xsd">XML
schema</a> for the XML. I used a
library called <a href="https://xsdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">xsData</a>,
which lets you take an XML scheme and generate Python dataclasses
corresponding to it, which make manipulating the parsed XML much easier than
the standard library xml library. The script outputs text like</p>

These are the original comments on this post that were made when this blog used the [Disqus blog system](https://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/switching-to-utterances-comments/).

&gt;**Comment from bjd2385 on 2016-08-28 12:33:12+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very interesting post. I was just looking into hash functions (I've never formally learned what the topic entails), and since I'm most familiar with Python this post explained quite a bit, especially your early mathematical points.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Comment from Mark Lawrence on 2016-10-03 20:26:54+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;At what point does Python 3 force the override of __hash__ if you've defined __eq__?  E.g when would your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AlwaysEqual class fail?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Replies:**

&gt;&gt;**Comment from asmeurer on 2016-10-03 20:38:13+00:00:**

&gt;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a good catch. I originally wrote this post in Python 2. The example does indeed fail in Python 3. More specifically, if you override __eq__, Python 3 automatically sets __hash__ to None. I'll update the post to make this more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Comment from Erick Mendon&#231;a on 2017-07-30 03:23:55+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great article! We must really pay attention to these details when implementing custom hashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;**Comment from Ignacio on 2017-10-07 22:31:56+00:00:**

&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for this post! Clarified a lot of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>which I then manually copied to each post's Utterances page on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Utterances Comments</h3>
<p>Feel free to use the comments on this page to play around with the commenting
system.</p>
<p>Note that to comment, there are two options. You can log in on this page,
which will let you type your comment in the box below. This requires giving
the Utterances bot access to your GitHub account. Alternately, if you don't
want to give a bot access, you can just go directly to the GitHub issue page
and comment there. I am currently in the process of figuring out how to add
some boilerplate to each page that makes this clear (see <a href="https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/355">this Utterances
issue</a>). If anyone has any
suggestions on how to do this, let me know. For now, I am just going to
manually add a statement about this as the first comment on each post.</p></div>

						<p>This summer I had plenty of time during COVID-19 lockdown and I was looking at
<a href="https://sympygamma.com/">SymPy Gamma</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://iamit.in/assets/sympy-gamma-port/sympy_gamma_demo.gif" width="700" /></center>

<h2 id="sympy-gamma">Sympy Gamma</h2>

<p>SymPy Gamma is a web application that executes mathematical expressions
via natural language input from the user, after parsing them as SymPy
expressions it displays the result with additional related computations.
It is inspired from the idea of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a> which is based on the
commercial Computer Algebra System named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica">&#8220;Mathematica&#8221;</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://iamit.in/assets/wolfram-alpha-logo.svg" width="300" /></center>

<p>I have always been impressed by it ever since I first found about it.
While playing with it during this summer, I realised that it runs on Google
App Engine&#8217;s Python 2.7 runtime. It is powered by SymPy, an open source
computer algebra system.</p>

<center><img align="center" src="https://iamit.in/assets/Sympy_logo.svg" width="150" /></center>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Despite being widely used around the world (about ~14K users everyday,
as seen from Google Analytics), there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of development
in the past 5 years. Due to this the current infrastructure
was stuck on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine">Google App Engine</a>&#8217;s Python 2 runtime which obviously does
not support Python 3.</p>

<p>This also prevented it to use the latest version of SymPy. The SymPy
version (~0.7.6) it was using was last updated 6 years ago. This made
SymPy Gamma in urgent need for upgradation. At the time of writing this blog,
SymPy Gamma is running on Google App Engine&#8217;s latest runtime and latest
version of SymPy.</p>

<h2 id="solution-and-process">Solution and Process</h2>

<p>It was a fun project and was interesting to see how Google cloud offering has evolved
from Google App Engine to Google Cloud Platform. The old App engine did
seem like a minimal cloud offering launched by Google in an attempt to
ship something early and quickly. It reminded me of my first cloud project
in college (<a href="https://github.com/aktech/dturmscrap">dturmscrap</a>), which I
deployed to Google App Engine, back in 2015.</p>

<p>I used Github projects to track the whole project, all the work done for this
can be seen <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="-git-log">$ Git Log</h2>

<p>Here is a summary of what was achieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/135">PR 135</a>: Migrating Django to a slightly higher version,
this was the first blood just to make sure everything was working. I upgraded it to the latest version of
Django that was supported on Python 2 runtime. This also exposed the broken CI, which was fixed in this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/137">PR 137</a>: This upgraded the CI infrastructure to use Google Cloud SDK
for deployment, the previous method was discontinued.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/140">PR 140</a>: Upgrading the Database backend to use Cloud NDB instead
of the legacy App Engine NDB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/148">PR 148</a>: Since we change the database backend, we needed something for
testing locally, this was done by using Google Cloud Datastore emulator locally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/149">PR 149</a>: The installation and setup of the project was quite a challenge.
Installing and keeping track of the versions of a number of application was non-trivial. This Pull request dockerized
the project and made the development setup trivial and it all boiled down to just one command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/152">PR 152</a>: The login feature was previously implemented using the user API
of the Google App Engine&#8217;s Python2 runtime, which was not available in Python 3 runtime. We removed the login feature as it
was not used by many and was too much effort to setup OAuth for login.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/153">PR 153</a>: Now was the time to slowly move towards Python 3 by making the
code compatible with both 2 and 3. It was achieved via <a href="https://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-modernize</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/154">PR 154</a>: We then made the migration to Python 3.7 runtime and removed submodules
and introduced a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code> for installing dependencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/154">PR 159</a>: The above change made it possible to upgrade SymPy to latest version,
which was 1.6 at that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma/pull/154">PR 165</a>: The last piece of the puzzle was upgrading Django itself, so we upgraded
it to the latest version, which was Django 3.0.8.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h4>

<ul>
  <li>At the time of writing this Google has released the Python 3.8 runtime, it would nice to further upgrade it now.</li>
  <li>The test coverage can be increased.</li>
  <li>The code can be refactored to be more readable and approachable for new contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Google for properly <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/migrate-to-python3">documenting the process</a>,
which made the transition much easier.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFocus</a>, without them this project would not have been possible. Also thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/certik">Ondrej Certik</a> and <a href="http://github.com/asmeurer">Aaron Meurer</a> for their advice and support
throughout the project.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Refactoring high level functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nseries</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lseries</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aseries</code>.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_is_meromorphic</code> method or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_singularities</code> to as many special functions as possible.</li>
  <li>Work can be done to resolve the issues opened by me (listed above).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This summer has been a great learning experience and has helped me get a good exposure of test-driven development. I plan to continue contributing to SymPy and will also try to help the new contributors. I am grateful to my mentors, <a href="https://github.com/jksuom">Kalevi Suominen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leosartaj">Sartaj Singh</a> for reviewing my work, giving me valuable suggestions, and being readily available for discussions.</p>

        <p>We added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_is_meromorphic</code> method to class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code> so that some of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limits</code> involving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code> functions 
get evaluated using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meromorphic check</code> already present in the limit codebase. Now, to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code> functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tractable</code> for limit evaluations, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_aseries</code> method was added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowergamma</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_rewrite_as_tractable</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uppergamma</code>.</p>

        <p>Finally, we also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rectified</code> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval</code> method of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">besselk</code>, so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">besselk(nu, oo)</code> automatically evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19916">Fixed limit evaluations related to trigonometric functions</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In this PR, we added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_nseries</code> method to both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sin</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cos</code> to make the limit evaluations more robust when it comes to trigonometric functions.
We also added a piece of code to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cos.eval</code> method so that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limit of cos(m*x)</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">non-zero</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> tends to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oo</code> evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AccumBounds(-1, 1)</code>.</li>

						<p>Key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlights</code> of this week&#8217;s work are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19716">Fixed incorrect limit evaluation related to LambertW function</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>This was a minor bug fix. We added the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_singularities</code> feature to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LambertW</code> function so that its limit gets evaluated using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meromorphic check</code> already present in the limit codebase.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/18696">Fixed errors in assumptions when rewriting RisingFactorial / FallingFactorial as gamma or factorial</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a long pending issue. The rewrite to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gamma</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">factorial</code> methods of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RisingFactorial</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FallingFactorial</code> did not handle all the possible cases, which caused errors in some evaluations.
Thus, we decided to come up with a proper rewrite using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Piecewise</code> which accordingly returned the correct rewrite depending on the assumptions on the variables.
Handling such rewrites using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Piecewise</code> is never easy, and thus there were a lot of failing testcases.
After spending a lot of time debugging and fixing each failing testcase, we were finally able to merge this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This marks the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phase-2</code> of the program. I learnt a lot during these two months and gained many important things from my mentors.</p>

						<p>Key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlights</code> of this week&#8217;s work are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19680">Improved the limit evaluations of Power objects</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This PR improves the limit evaluations of Power objects.
We first check if the limit expression is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Power object</code> and then accordingly evaluate the limit depending on different cases.
First of all, we express <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b**e</code> in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exp(e*log(b))</code>. After this, we check if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e*log(b)</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meromorphic</code> and accordingly evaluate the final result.
This check helps us to handle the trivial cases in the beginning itself.</p>

        <p>Now, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e*log(b)</code> is not meromorphic, then we separately evaluate the limit of the base and the exponent.
This helps us to determine the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">indeterminant form</code> of the limit expression if present. 
As we know, there are 3 indeterminate forms corresponding to power objects: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0**0</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oo**0</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1**oo</code>, which need to be handled carefully.
If there is no indeterminate form present, then no further evaluations are required. Otherwise, we handle all the three cases separately and correctly evaluate the final result.</p>

        <p>We also added some code to improve the evaluation of limits having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abs()</code> expressions.
For every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Abs()</code> term present in the limit expression, we replace it simply by its argument or the negative of its argument, depending on
whether the value of the limit of the argument is greater than zero or less than zero for the given limit variable.</p>

        <p>Finally, we were able to merge this after resolving some failing testcases.
<br /><br /></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19697">Fixed limit evaluations involving error functions</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The incorrect limit evaluations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error functions</code> were mainly because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tractable</code> rewrite was wrong and did not handle all the possible cases.
For a proper rewrite, it was required that the limit variable be passed to the corresponding rewrite method.
This is because, to define a correct rewrite we had to evaluate the limit of the argument of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error function</code>, for the passed limit variable.
Thus, we added a default argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limitvar</code> to all the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tractable rewrite</code> methods and resolved this issue.
While debugging, we also noticed that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_eval_as_leading_term</code> method of error function was wrong, hence it was also fixed.</p>

        <p>Finally, we were able to merge this after resolving some failing testcases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19646">Fixed RecursionError and Timeout in limit evaluations</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Recursion Errors</code> in limit evaluations were mainly due to the fact that the indeterminant form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1**oo</code> was not handled accurately in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mrv()</code> function of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gruntz algorithm</code>. So, some minor changes were required to fix those.</p>

        <p>The major issue was to handle those cases which were timing out. On deep digging, we identified that the 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel()</code> function of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polytools.py</code> was the reason. Thus, we decided to completely transform the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel()</code> function to speed up its algorithm. 
Now after this major modification, many testcases were failing as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel()</code> function plays an important role in simplifying evaluations and 
is thus used at many places across the codebase. Therefore, a lot of time was spent in debugging and rectifying these testcases.</p>

        <p>Finally we were able to merge this, enhancing the limit evaluation capabilities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code>.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19555">Adds cdir parameter to handle series expansions on branch cuts</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, after spending almost 2 weeks on this, we were able to merge the PR, adding a very important functionality of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series expansions</code> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch cuts</code> to the codebase. 
Previously, either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code> raised some error or the series expansion was computed incorrectly, when the value in the input was on the branch cut. But now, for most of the functions, the expansion produced is correct.</p>

        <p>Not only this, we added the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cdir</code> parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leadterm</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as_leading_term</code> functions as well. We even extended the functionality a bit to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limits</code> module, so now, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">limits</code> of values lying on the branch cuts of a function are also computed correctly in most cases.</p>

        <p>We are planning to extend this functionality to all the remaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">special functions</code> and wherever else possible to make the codebase even more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robust</code>.</p>

						<p>Key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlights</code> of this week&#8217;s work are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19515">Fixed incorrect evaluation caused due to subfactorial in limit_seq expression</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>This was a minor bug fix. 
The functionality of rewriting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subfactorial</code> term present in an expression into an equivalent term expressed in 
the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">factorial</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gamma</code> was added which helped resolve the issue.
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19555">Adds cdir parameter to handle series expansions on branch cuts</a></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Currently, many functions in the codebase are unable to produce correct <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">series expansions</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch cuts</code>. As a result,
the limit evaluation takes place incorrectly for these functions when the limiting value lies on the branch cuts.</p>

        <p>Thus, we have decided to come up with a parameter named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cdir</code> which stands for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complex direction</code> and it indicates the direction from which the series expansion is required, thus helping us
to produce the correct series expansion. Special care needs to be taken while handling series expansions on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch points</code>.</p>

        <p>Once we are finished with this work, it will be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">major enhancement</code> to the limit evaluation and series expansion capabilities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This marks the end of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phase-1</code> of the program. I learnt a lot during this one month and gained many important things from my mentors.</p>

                    <p>If you are a SymPy contributor you can have your blog on Planet SymPy. Blog content can be SymPy/SymEngine/SciPy/Python themed, English language and not liable to offend. If you have a general blog you may want to set up a tag and subscribe the feed for that tag only to Planet SymPy.</p>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is kept in GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy">here</a>. If you have an account you can add or edit your own feed: </p>

                        </li>

                        <li>Put your hackergotchi in <em>website/hackergotchi/</em>. A hackergotchi should be a photo of your face smaller than 80x80 pixels with a transparent background. <em>git add</em> the file.</li>

                        <li>At the end of the <em>planetsympy/config</em> file add your details (the name in brackets is your GitHub handle):</li>
                        <div id="addmebox"><pre>

                        <li>Send in a PR ;)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you do not have a GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy/issues/new">file an issue in the issue tracker</a> listing your name, GitHub account (if you have one), RSS or Atom feed. Attach a photo of your face for hackergotchi.</p>

                    <h2>Planet SymPy Guidelines</h2>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is one of the public faces of the SymPy project and is read by many users and potential contributors. The content aggregated at Planet SymPy is the opinions of its authors, but the sum of that content gives an impression of the project. Please keep in mind the following guidelines for your blog content and read the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">SymPy Code of Conduct</a>. The SymPy project reserves the right to remove an inappropriate blog from the Planet.</p>

                    <h3>Blogs should be SymPy themed</h3>

                    <p>The majority of content in your blog should be about SymPy and your work on SymPy. The blog can also be about anything that interests SymPy community, for example, scientific computing, language syntax and semantics, etc. Blog posts about personal subjects are also encouraged since Planet SymPy is a chance to learn more about the developers behind SymPy. However blog feeds should not be entirely personal, if in doubt set up a tag for Planet SymPy and subscribe the feed from that tag so you can control what gets posted.</p>

                    <h3>Posts should be constructive</h3>

                    <p>Posts can be positive and promote SymPy, they can be constructive and lay out issues which need to be addressed, but blog feeds should not contain useless, destructive and negative material. Constructive criticism is welcome and the occasional rant is understandable, but a feed where every post is critical and negative is unsuitable. This helps to keep SymPy overall a happy project.</p>

                    <h3>You must be a SymPy contributor</h3>

                    <p>Only have your blog on Planet SymPy if you actively contribute to SymPy, for example through code, user support, documentation etc.</p>

                    <h3>It must be a personal blog, or in a blog class</h3>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is a collection of blogs from SymPy contributors.</p>

                    <h3>Do not inflame</h3>

                    <p>SymPy covers a wide variety of people and cultures. Profanities, prejudice, lewd comments and content likely to offend are to be avoided. Do not make personal attacks or attacks against other projects on your blog.</p>

                    <p>For further guidance on good practice see the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">SymPy Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
