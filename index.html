						<p>Hello everyone! I am glad to present some of my progress during this past week.</p>



<ul><li>Overview</li></ul>



<p>I was mainly working on the sparse aray issue over this week. A sparse array is, by a brief definition, an array in which most of the elements are zero.  In order to save the memory cost, sparse array is distinguished from the dense array(which means most of elements are non-zero) and then is stored and manipulated in a different way. The default data format in SymPy for sparse array is called Dictionary of keys (DOK), where the non-zero value is stored in a dictionary.</p>



<p>However, the sparse array is cast to dense array in various ways. So what I am trying to do is to free these sparse arrays and nake good use of them for cases like large scale sparse array operations. </p>



<ul><li>PRs</li></ul>



<p>The PR about derive_by_array <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937">#16937</a> is not yet merged. Thank to the guidance of my mentor Francesco, the PR is being ameliorated and now has satisfactory result. Besides the operation of derive_by_array, I have updated as well the way Array module perform a equality test and apply function. To show the result of these changes, let&#8217;s see what the behavior of derive_by_array was:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>>>> a = MutableSparseNDimArray.zeros(10000, 20000)
>>> a[1, 1] = i
>>> a[1, 2] = j
>>> d = derive_by_array(a, i)
MemoryError
>>> d = derive_by_array(a, (i, j))
MemoryError</code></pre>



<p>The sparse array is cast to a list which leads to the MemoryError. Now, we can have:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>>>> a = MutableSparseNDimArray.zeros(10000, 20000)
>>> a[1, 1] = i
>>> derive_by_array(a, i) = ImmutableSparseNDimArray({20001:1},(10000, 20000))
True
>>> a[1, 2] = j
>>> derive_by_array(a, (i, j)) == ImmutableSparseNDimArray({20001: 1, 200020002: 1},(2, 10000, 20000))
True</code></pre>



<p>The operation is much more rapid and can save a lot of spaces of memory. </p>



<p>Francesco also helped to improve the quality of codes. For example, to perform the deriative of a sparse array, he suggested me to use a dictionary comprehension instead of a for loop, so an extra function is replaced by one single line of code.</p>



<p>A new PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16994">#16994</a> about __mul__ and__rmul__ is opened, which solves the problem of casting in these operators. Same as another new PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17000">#17000</a> for tensorproduct. However, these PRs cannot pass the test for now because the issue about equality test is not yet fixed and merged into master of SymPy.</p>



<p>A new PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16969">#16969</a> about adding functions and tests for ArrayComprehension is merged, which added functions like .tomatrix(), .tolist() for this class.</p>



<ul><li>Issues</li></ul>



<p>I have opened a issue <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16984">#16984</a> about equality test of Dict and dict objects. I ran into this case while comparing the dictionaries of sparse array. Fortunately, this issue is recently fixed. </p>



<ul><li>Reviews</li></ul>



<p>No reviews for other contributors&#8217; PR. I have participated in the review of my own PRs since there are some errors have been found after the creation of PR.</p>



<ul><li>Related works</li></ul>



<p>I have participated in the discussion about the nature of ArrayComprehension in the community this week. Comprehension is a new class that I implemented last week(See <a href="https://www.kangzhiq.com/2019/06/03/gsoc-week-1/">last post</a> for more details) This discussion helped me better understand the difference between a multipledimensional list and an array: an array is suppposed to perform vectorized operations while list is mosyly element-wise.</p>

						<p>The second week has ended and here I am to give you a brief about the week&#8217;s work!</p>
<p>The week started with the opening of a <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16964">PR #16964</a> which intended to define a class <strong>CrossSection </strong>as planned. Discussions have been done in this PR regarding its API and its need. All these discussions lead to a conclusion of making a slight change in the API to make it accept any arbitrary cross-section which the user can define using the geometry module. So now the <strong>CrossSection</strong> class will take the input of a pre-defined object of the geometry module and calculate its corresponding properties. This will make the <strong>CrossSection</strong> class much simpler and generalized. I will be updating the same in the <strong>PR</strong> soon.</p>
<p>I had also researched some of the previous works done in this area. <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14434">PR #14434</a>, which intends to implement a shape class, giving functionality to cut an ellipse or a parabola via a line and determine the properties of the newly formed segment. I have tried to implement a similar concept to the Polygon class via a method <strong>cut_section() </strong>in <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17001">PR #17001</a>.</p>
<p>Also since one of the major issues also was to determine the first moment of area, this PR would further help in the calculation of the first moment of area. It intends to give the Polygon class functionality to return a new Polygon segment formed when a given line intersects the Polygon. Although, an alternative method of <strong>Polygon triangulation</strong> also has been discussed in this PR, to determine the first moment. I will have to do a bit of research for this to get this implemented<strong>.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Next Week:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementing a method to determine the first moment of area</li>
<li>Completing the CrossSection class along with its documentation and testing</li>
<li>Linking it with the beam module</li>
<li>Working over the implementation of <strong>Stage-II</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I will try to make the CrossSection class fully functional, by the end of the coming week.</p>
<p>Will keep you updated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

						<p>This week involved a lot of work and reviews. I worked on three PRs this week which were started for the purpose of, Markov chains, symbolic dimensions and symbolic conditions for finite RVs. Let me tell you how I managed all this.</p>

<p>The most important and the most demanding PR from all the said topics was that of Markov chain. I told you that we were discussing API for the same. Fortunately the discussion concluded and I started implementation with the starting of the second week, by opeining <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16981">#16981</a>. Infact, the basic structure is ready and I am vary happy, that the code is able to handle <code class="highlighter-rouge">probability</code> queries and is generating desirable results. Out of curiosity, I started work on symbolic dimensions for helping one of my fellow students. Infact, it&#8217;s also going to be completed, see <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962">#16962</a>. The work for symbolic conditions which started for the purpose of correcting <code class="highlighter-rouge">@XFAIL</code> tests is also almost complete, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16908">#16908</a>. I have observed that still there are some issues with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sympy.stats.frv</code> which need to be handled in a different set of PRs. Hopefully, I am planning to make some of those this week if time permits. I also aim to add more features to <code class="highlighter-rouge">StochasticProcess</code> like <code class="highlighter-rouge">joint_distribution</code>, and adding more properties to <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiscreteMarkovChain</code> like, whether it&#8217;s absorbing, transient. Adding, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ContinuousMarkovChain</code> will also be on my list.</p>

<p>Apart from a lot of work there was a lot of learning too. I got many of my concepts cleared, like, inherit <code class="highlighter-rouge">Basic</code> only when the instance of the class is going to be a part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">SymPy</code> expression. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/certik">Ond&#345;ej &#268;ert&#237;k</a> for this. I also realized the worth of <code class="highlighter-rouge">sympy.stats.symbolic_probability</code> while working on symbolic dimensions. Francesco used to suggest that we should use it wherever necessary, but now I completely understand his view.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all, thanks for reading. Bye!!</p>

						<p>This was the second week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Saturday 8th June, 2019 between 12:00 - 01:00 PM (IST). Me, Amit, Yathartha and Harsh
were the attendees of the meeting. It was a surprise having Harsh on this meeting.
In this meeting we mainly discussed about how to integrate lambert another way because
the existing method in PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890">#16890</a> is
not trustworthy and upto the mark. So this week I will try to implement the method
or approach told by Yathartha. Important lesson learned in this meeting was that
the method that I implement should have these following qualities to be a better
software developer:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proof Of Correctness</li>
</ul>

<p>This is very important because I should have a plan before I get to code. Many
things already get straightened up while planning for what to implement and it
ultimately reduces coding time and let us get a more accurate and concrete code.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean and Understandable Code</li>
</ul>

<p>This factor is also very important to write a code that is easily understandable.
It is better for us as well as it also persuade new contributors easily who are
willing to contribute.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extensible Code</li>
</ul>

<p>A well written code is always extensible. Proper techniques should be learned to
write an extensible code rather than a code that looks like patch.</p>

<p>In this week I also started a PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16976">#16976</a>
to handle modular equations.<br />
It was a worth it meeting because I got to learn various important and necessary
qualities from all of the mentors. Harsh was also glad that we were trying to focus
on well written clean code.</p>

<p>A lot more to learn and implement :) !!</p>

        <p><em>See the <a href="https://anpandey.github.io/2019-05-31-week-1.html">previous post</a> for Week 1</em>.</p>
<p>For this week, I&#8217;ve continued working on adding support for LFortran to SymPy&#8217;s code generation capabilities. This week mostly involved getting the infrastructure for testing the functionality of the new code generator working. I also extended the number of expressions the generator can handle, in addition to adding to LFortran&#8217;s ability to parse numbers upstream.</p>
<h2 id="more-expressions">More Expressions</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve added support for four more expression types that the generator can handle: <code>Float</code>, <code>Rational</code>, <code>Pow</code> and <code>Function</code>. Since our base translation class was already in place from last week, implementing these was relatively straightforward and involved just defining the node visitors for each expression type (The commit that implements this can be found <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16931/commits/67a06a83d4aa239e8d319837d9ed7d11b67f7846">here</a>). Here&#8217;s a demonstration showing the abstract syntax tree generated from translating the expression <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mrow><mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mo><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mo></mrow><mi>x</mi></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{x}</annotation></semantics></math>:</p>

<p>However, the translator fails for expressions that should in theory work. Right now, we can&#8217;t add an integer to a symbol because symbols default to real numbers, resulting in a type mismatch:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pprint_asr(sympy_to_lfortran(<span class="dv">3</span> <span class="op">+</span> x))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">lfortran.asr.asr_check.TypeMismatch: Type mismatch</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Fortran allows the implicit conversion of a float to a real, and the expression shouldn&#8217;t generate an error. This is functionality that will hopefully be implemented by the time I come back to this project close to the end of the summer.</p>
<h2 id="testing-the-lfortran-converter">Testing the LFortran Converter</h2>
<p>I also added the initial infrastructure for testing the new code generation functions, with the starting commit available <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16931/commits/918c12de43e319f8d3f16d48c19f25d1db248909">here</a>. As Aaron mentioned in one of our meetings, the plan right now is for code generated by the LFortran backend to be equivalent to the output generated by the existing <code>fcode</code> at the AST level. Each test should be in the form of an assertion that tests the (parsed) output of <code>fcode</code> applied to a SymPy expression against the same AST generated by our newly implemented <code>sympy_to_lfortran</code>. The LFortran project already has code to check generated ASTs against expected values, so I adapted this to the testing library of our code generator (I&#8217;m also not sure how this works in terms of licensing, since both SymPy and LFortran use the BSD-3 license).</p>
<p>One problem that immediately became apparent was the way that LFortran represents numbers. Looking at the expression tree above, the real numbers are actually stored as strings. On the parser side, LFortran stores a real number as the string used to represent that number. This means that the ASTs of two expressions that represent the same number in different ways are not identical (for example, <code>1.0_dp</code> and <code>1.d0</code> both represent the same double precision floating point number, but the strings stored by LFortran will be different). It&#8217;s only at the &#8220;annotation&#8221; stage of evaluation that LFortran canonicalizes floating point representations. For now, the tests use the annotation function of this stage, and I filed a <a href="https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/merge_requests/225">merge request</a> on the LFortran project to add support for parsing numbers in the way that <code>fcode</code> generates them.</p>
<p>While the initial infrastructure is in place, I haven&#8217;t added any tests yet. Since the LFortran project is still in early alpha, the functionality needed to compare the syntax tree made by the builder API against the syntax tree parsed from the output of <code>fcode</code> hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet. Again, this is something that will hopefully be implemented in LFortran near the end of the summer when I start on this portion of the project again.</p>
<h3 id="contributing-upstream">Contributing Upstream</h3>
<p>After I filed the merge request to add the functionality I needed to LFortran, Ondr&#780;ej (the creator of LFortran and one of my mentors) mentioned that he was planning on eventually removing the module I contributed to. The merge request I filed actually wasn&#8217;t the one I had in mind at first. I thought about adding support for canonicalizing number nodes right after they&#8217;re created in the builder API, but I decided against this because I felt that any changes I made would have to be minimally invasive. In retrospect, this was probably a misplaced concern, since it&#8217;s important to consider the development stage of a project when deciding how much of it should be changed. Because of this, LFortran will probably end up with something I opted at the moment to not implement.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s still some work left to be done with LFortran, such as filing issues I encountered and preparing the pull request for a merge (though it&#8217;ll probably remain a work in progress for some time). After that, I&#8217;ll be finished with LFortran for the time being and move on to extending support for matrix expressions in the Python code generator. The Python code generator can already convert (most) matrix expressions through NumPy, though there are still some bugs owing to an incomplete implementation. For next week, I&#8217;ll have to figure out what this missing functionality is how it can be implemented.</p>

						<p>The coding period has been started from 27 may 2019 and the first week went well. We worked on the composition series computation for solvable groups. I was waiting for the PR to get merged so, that I can include a fully completed PR here &#128578;. Kalevi helped a lot in reviewing and helping me with the algorithm. The PR link is <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16881">here</a>.</p>

<p>Till now, everything is going as it was planned. The abelian invariants PR has been already merged in the community bonding period itself, may be some other time I&#8217;ll discuss about the details of it but for the time being one can look into the PR of abelian invariants <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16670">here</a>.</p>

<p>Composition series of a group <code class="highlighter-rouge">G</code> is defined as the subnormal series <code class="highlighter-rouge">G = H_0 &gt; H_1 &gt; H_2 \ldots &gt; H_k = 1</code> where every factor group
<code class="highlighter-rouge">H(i+1)/H(i)</code> is simple. The algorithm is described in the implementation itself. We wanted to make sure, the implemeted method work as expected so, I wrote a good amount of tests and examples in the docs.</p>

<p>The tasks that I&#8217;m hopping to accomplish in the next week are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss with Kalevi about the Polycyclic group implementation.</li>
  <li>In the end of the week get ready with WIP PR on pc groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopping I&#8217;ll be able to execute things as planned! Till then good bye, keep learning.</p>

						<p>Hello everyone! Here comes the end of the first coding week. This blog is dedicated to present the progress that I have had during the past week. </p>



<ul><li>PRs</li></ul>



<p>This week the PR about  ArrayComprehension   is merged. <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16845">#16845</a>. This class is designed as an extension of list comprehension in Python, which enables the list comprehension with symbolic dimensions. </p>



<p>A new PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937">#16937</a> about the sparse array being cast to dense array in the case of derive_by_array is opened. But somes improvements are still needed. The challenge is to find an approriate method to override and perform a derivative correctly. </p>



<ul><li>Issues</li></ul>



<p>An issue <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16911">#16911</a> is opened. It is in fact a discussion about implementing a NumPy-Like behavior in Array module. It is interesting because my mentor was, at first, not in favor of this implementation. But some differences of behavior between the Array module in SymPy and the one in NumPy did change his mind. So this implementation can be kept in my proposal and will be my tasks for the next phase.</p>



<p>Another issue <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16941">#16941</a> whose aim is to list out all cases where a sparse array is cast to dense arrays is opened this week. Not only as a discussion, this issue would also be a overview of the problems so that the PRs like <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16937">#16937</a> can refer to it. A checklist is being updated to show the avancement. </p>



<p>Please feel free to comment on the issues or the PRs that I opened. I would love to listen to your opinions.</p>



<ul><li>Reviews</li></ul>



<p>After the merge of ArrayComprehension, another student  <a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807">Gagandeep Singh</a>  opened a new PR to ameliorate the code quality of this class. I have also participated as a reviewer to offer some help. I have also leant a lot from the discussion.</p>



<ul><li>Related works</li></ul>



<p>Not much, due to the burden of projects in college. </p>

						<p>The <strong>GSoC</strong> timeline started as soon as the projects were announced and so did the work on projects.</p>
<p>The <strong>Community bonding</strong> period ended last week. There wasn&#8217;t much work in the community bonding period. All I had to do was to extend my knowledge base related to the project and to familiarize with the development flow.</p>
<p>I started with going through the geometry module, which has a major role to play in the implementation of the <strong>Stage-I</strong> i.e. the implementation of CrossSection module. Also, I studied about the different properties of cross-sections, like, the first moment of area, polar modulus, section modulus, etc.</p>
<p>So the coding period started on <strong>27<sup>th</sup> May</strong> and now the first week is completed. My task in the first week was to start the implementation of the CrossSection module. It majorly comprised of defining a <strong>new class CrossSection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Major tasks</strong> inside the CrossSection class were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the different geometries using the geometry module:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circle:&#160;</strong>A circular cross-section was easily defined by using class <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/geometry/ellipses.html#sympy.geometry.ellipse.Circle">sympy.geometry.ellipses.Circle</a><span>.&#160;</span></li>
<li><strong>Rectangle, I-section, T-section, triangle:&#160;</strong>These four shapes were defined using class <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/geometry/polygons.html#sympy.geometry.polygon.Polygon">sympy.geometry.polygons.Polygon</a>. These geometries were defined using <strong>point to point mapping</strong> in the counter-clockwise direction in such a way that it starts at the origin and joins all the given points or vertices of the polygon in the given sequence.</li>
<li>All these geometries were defined in a way that they lie in the first quadrant, in order to get correct values of the centroid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining different properties of the above cross-sections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Area</li>
<li>Centroid</li>
<li>Second moment</li>
<li>Polar modulus</li>
<li>Section Modulus</li>
<li>First moment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing these was not that difficult as area, centroid, the second moment are already implemented in the geometry module. On the other hand, polar modulus and section modulus were specifically defined in the CrossSection module separately for each geometry.</p>
<h2><strong>The problem of defining the first moment of area: </strong></h2>
<p>The way the first moment of area is calculated can be seen from <a href="https://skyciv.com/tutorials/calculating-statical-or-first-moment-of-area-of-beam-sections/">here</a>. And since the first moment of area is required majorly to calculate the <a href="http://abe-research.illinois.edu/faculty/dickc/Engineering/beamshear2b.htm">Transverse shear stress</a> on a beam, we are interested only in the first moment along the x-axis (or the horizontal axis).</p>
<p>But just a day pondering over it I realized that the first moment calculated as above calculates it for the extreme layer of the beam. Probably, we will have to return it <strong>in terms of y</strong>, so that the shear stress at any layer could be calculated.</p>
<p><em><strong>where &#8220;y&#8221;&#160;</strong>is the distance of the layer of the beam from the neutral axis</em></p>
<p>So, I will be opening an <strong>issue-cum-discussion </strong>regarding the above problem to discuss it with the mentors. Also, I will soon be opening a <strong>work-in-progress</strong> <strong>PR</strong> regarding what has been implemented.</p>
<h2><strong>Next Week:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Completing the CrossSection class and linking it with the beam module via an<strong> add_cross_section() </strong>function.</li>
<li>Adding tests to the CrossSection module and in the Beam module</li>
<li>Completing documentation of the CrossSection module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I had to travel this weekend there was a bit of delay in the progress. But I am positive that I will be able to compensate for it in the next week. Also, I will try to keep the work a bit in advance.</p>
<p>Will keep you updated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

						<p>The first week of official coding phase is over and it&#8217;s time to tell you about what I did and what I learnt. So here it goes.</p>

<p>I started discussion with my mentor about API design of Markov chain. We have more clarity about the same than before. The final API will be somewhat closer to the one mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/16895#issuecomment-497649797">this</a> comment. The discussion about probability space of stochastic process is under way. We will conclude that soon.</p>

<p>I also made some PRs during this week for improving the distributions which I added during the bonding period. The PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16914">#16914</a> allowed the possibility of symbolic dimensions in <code class="highlighter-rouge">MultivariateEwens</code>. We earlier decided that we will use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArrayComprehension</code> which one of my fellow students developed. However, currently it needs a lot of improvements before being put to use. I have made an attempt to optimise the code of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArrayComprehension</code> via PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16929">#16929</a>. It also covers some cases which were left during the inital merge. I have also tried to allow symbolic conditions to finite probability spaces. I have two approaches for review. One of them is in the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16908/files">diff of PR #16908</a> and the other one is in <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16908#issuecomment-497950242">this</a> comment. I have also made some minor improvements like changing namespace of <code class="highlighter-rouge">joint_rv_types</code> via PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16919">#16919</a>, enhancement of <code class="highlighter-rouge">P</code> in PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16907">#16907</a> and some general bug fixes in <code class="highlighter-rouge">MarginalDistribution</code> at PR <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16934">#16934</a>.</p>

<p>Doing all this I learnt a lot of things. The most important was that API design matters the most. Without it, it&#8217;s not possible to develop a good class structure. Thanks to Francesco for making me learn this fact. The other thing is, how sometimes even to make small changes in a large code base, it takes hours to get it right. Another fact which I learnt is how small optimisations in a large of code base can improve the performance.</p>

<p>See you next week with some more progress. :)</p>

						<p>This was the first week meeting with the GSoC mentors which was scheduled on
Sunday 2nd June, 2019 between 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (IST). Me, Amit and Yathartha
were the attendees of the meeting. In this meeting we mainly discussed about the
problems and implementation for my pull request <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16890">#16890</a>
to complete the lambert solver.<br />
As Amit requested changes at the pull request to describe the problem in detail,
to give proof of correctness and describe the plan more briefly. So here below
are the all details for what I am trying to achieve and how I am trying to
achieve this:-</p>

<h3 id="current-implementation">Current Implementation</h3>

implementation so that I could describe the problem in detail:-</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Explanation of for loop:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">k == -1</code> :- In this case all the real solutions are considered due to <code class="highlighter-rouge">not l.is_real</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">k == 0</code> :- In this case all the solutions come out to be real as always.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-solutions-are-missed">What solutions are missed?</h3>
<p>The solutions are missed due to the argument inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">LambertW</code> function of value</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>l = LambertW(d/(a*b)*exp(c*d/a/b)*exp(-f/a), k)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>While converting all lambert solvable equations to this form
<code class="highlighter-rouge">F(X, a..f) = a*log(b*X + c) + d*X + f = 0</code> some solutions get missed.</p>

<p>For eg:
Consider the equation <code class="highlighter-rouge">(a/x + exp(x/2)).diff(x) = 0</code> which is
<code class="highlighter-rouge">-a/x**2 + exp(x/2)/2 = 0</code>(Please take note of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">x**2</code> in denominator of a).
And we can also write this equation as <code class="highlighter-rouge">-a/(-x)**2 + exp(x/2)/2 = 0</code>.
What sympy do is to convert this equation to this form:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>F(X, a..f) = a*log(b*X + c) + d*X + f = 0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">2*log(x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">2*log(-x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0</code> respectively:
So solutions corresponding to both equations are:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2*log(x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0 --&gt; [4*LambertW(sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4)] --&gt; this is currently included
2*log(-x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0 --&gt; [4*LambertW(-sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4)] --&gt; this is missed
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="what-type-of-lambert-type-equation-it-is-for">What type of lambert type equation it is for?</h3>
<p>This is for the equations where the changing of cofficients of the target equation doesn&#8217;t
change the original equation just like the above case.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-current-algorithm-to-solve-such-type-of-equation-and-whats-wrong-with-current-logic">What&#8217;s the current algorithm to solve such type of equation and what&#8217;s wrong with current logic?</h3>

<p>Current implementation is shown above and what is wrong is that it is not considering
the other logarithm equations which are originated from the original equation.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">2*log(-x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0</code> in case of <code class="highlighter-rouge">(a/x + exp(x/2)).diff(x) = 0</code>.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-proposed-solution">What&#8217;s the proposed solution?</h3>

<p>This problem can be solved by two methods as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combining all the logarithm forms generated by the original equation(by taking abs)
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2*log(x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0 + 2*log(-x) + x/2 - log(a) = 0
                      \      /
                       \    /
                        \  /
          2*log(abs(x)) + x/2 - log(a) = 0                     
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>I think this method is not viable at this time as it will be very complex to solve
the equation invloving abs with log.</p>
  </li>
  <li>This method I propose to solve this problem i.e considering all solutions and
eliminating by substitution.
For example for this equation <code class="highlighter-rouge">(1/x + exp(x/2)).diff(x) = 0</code>
Possible solutions considered <code class="highlighter-rouge">[4*LambertW(-sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4), 4*LambertW(sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4), \
4*LambertW(-sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4, -1), 4*LambertW(sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4, -1)]</code>
Solutions after filtering from checksol <code class="highlighter-rouge">[4*LambertW(-sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4), 4*LambertW(sqrt(2)*sqrt(a)/4)]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-is-the-proposed-solution-better-and-how-it-wont-effect-the-other-equations-no-side-effects">Why is the proposed solution better and how it won&#8217;t effect the other equations (no side effects)?</h3>

<p>This method involves less computation to solve this problem i.e considering all solutions and
eliminating by substitution rather than first converting the given equation to target equation
in which we doesn&#8217;t know about coffecient of logarithmic equation and solving it again by
making different equations from it in case of abs taken.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t effect other equation because the only thing we are doing is considering all solutions
and not changing code for other type of equations. And we are using checksol to check the correct solutions.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-testing-strategy-to-verify-that-the-proposed-solution-works">What is the testing strategy to verify that the proposed solution works?</h3>
<p>Testing strategy should be to involve the cases where current implementation is
missing other logarithmic equations.</p>

    <section>
        <p>For the past week, I&#8217;ve been working on adding support for <a href="https://lfortran.org/">LFortran</a> to SymPy&#8217;s code generation capabilities. My current goal is to emulate SymPy&#8217;s <code>fcode</code>, which converts a SymPy expression to an equivalent expression in Fortran, utilizing only LFortran as a backend. This post is an outline of what I&#8217;ve done (and learned) over last week.</p>
<h2 id="lfortran">LFortran</h2>
<p>LFortran is a Fortran (with some extensions) to LLVM compiler. One advantage that this design provides is that it enables interactive execution of Fortran code. LFortran can also be used as a Jupyter kernel, which means it can be used in a Jupyter notebook environment (you can even find an online interactive demo <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/lfortran%2Fweb%2Flfortran-binder/master?filepath=Demo.ipynb">here</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to being able to parse code, LFortran also provides the functionality of traversing a parse tree and generating the equivalent Fortran code. This means that if we want to generate Fortran code from a SymPy expression, the only work that we have to do is convert the SymPy expression tree to its LFortran equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="lfortran-builder">LFortran Builder</h3>
<p>LFortran provides a number of convenience functions for building a Fortran AST. Since LFortran is still in early alpha, there are currently only about a dozen builder functions. However, these few basic functions are enough for constructing simple expressions in the Fortran AST. As an example, if we wanted to construct the expression represented by <code>c = a + b</code>, where each variable involved is an integer, we could do something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> lfortran.asr.builder <span class="im">as</span> builder</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> lfortran.asr.asr <span class="im">as</span> asr</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> integer <span class="op">=</span> builder.make_type_integer()</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> a <span class="op">=</span> asr.Variable(name<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;a&quot;</span>, <span class="bu">type</span><span class="op">=</span>integer)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" title="5"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> b <span class="op">=</span> asr.Variable(name<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;b&quot;</span>, <span class="bu">type</span><span class="op">=</span>integer)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" title="6"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span class="op">=</span> asr.Variable(name<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;c&quot;</span>, <span class="bu">type</span><span class="op">=</span>integer)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" title="7"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">sum</span> <span class="op">=</span> builder.make_binop(a, asr.Add(), b)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-8" title="8"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> expr <span class="op">=</span> asr.Assignment(c, <span class="bu">sum</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>LFortran also provides functionality to visualize what the expression tree looks like:</p>

<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> lfortran.asr.pprint <span class="im">as</span> pprint
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pprint.pprint_asr(expr)
<span class="kw">stmt.Assignment</span>
&#9500;&#9472;target<span class="op">=</span>c
&#9584;&#9472;value<span class="op">=</span><span class="kw">expr.BinOp</span>
  &#9500;&#9472;left<span class="op">=</span>a
  &#9500;&#9472;op<span class="op">=</span><span class="kw">operator.Add</span>
  &#9500;&#9472;right<span class="op">=</span>b
  &#9584;&#9472;type<span class="op">=</span><span class="kw">ttype.Integer</span>
    &#9500;&#9472;kind<span class="op">=</span><span class="dv">4</span>
    &#9584;&#9472;dims<span class="op">=</span>[]</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="sympy-to-lfortran-converter">Sympy to LFortran Converter</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve started with the implementation of a basic SymPy to LFortran converter utilizing the AST builder described above, with the current <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16931">pull request</a> available on the SymPy GitHub. The converter follows the same node visitor class structure as all of the other code printers (it even inherits the <code>CodePrinter</code> class, despite the methods not producing strings but rather AST nodes). Here&#8217;s a simple example that demonstrates the conversion of a simple expression to an equivalent in LFortran:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">from</span> sympy.abc <span class="im">import</span> x</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">from</span> sympy.codegen.lfort <span class="im">import</span> sympy_to_lfortran</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> lfortran</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" title="4"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e <span class="op">=</span> x <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" title="5"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e_converted <span class="op">=</span> sympy_to_lfortran(e)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-6" title="6"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lfortran.ast_to_src(lfortran.asr_to_ast(e_converted)).replace(<span class="st">'</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">'</span>, <span class="st">''</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-7" title="7"><span class="co">'(x) + (1)'</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>There are two things to notice here. The first is that I had to replace all the newlines in the generated expression, since a <a href="https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues/110">bug in LFortran</a> causes too many newlines to be printed. The second is that there are a number of redundant parentheses in the printed expression. While this isn&#8217;t an outright bug, it&#8217;s another aspect of LFortran that is currently being improved upon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also add another function, <code>sympy_to_lfortran_wrapped</code>, which wraps an expression in a function definition, (poorly) emulating the wrapping part of <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/utilities/autowrap.html"><code>autowrap</code></a>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">from</span> sympy.codegen.lfort <span class="im">import</span> sympy_to_lfortran_wrapped
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e_wrapped <span class="op">=</span> sympy_to_lfortran_wrapped(e)
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(lfortran.ast_to_src(lfortran.asr_to_ast(e_wrapped)))
<span class="st">integer function f(x) result(ret)
integer, intent(in) :: x
ret = 1 + x
end function</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Since LFortran can directly compile the AST to an LLVM intermediate representation, a future implementation of <code>autowrap</code> might be implemented by compiling the output of this function (instead of first completely generating the code and then feeding it to <code>gfortran</code> as it&#8217;s done right now).</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>For the next couple of days, I will try to extend the types of SymPy expressions that may be converted. One thing to note is that there isn&#8217;t a perfect correspondence between SymPy and LFortran AST nodes. LFortran supports nodes for operations like unary subtraction and division, which SymPy converts into multiplication and division respectively. On top of this, I&#8217;ll also add some tests for the functionality that I have implemented so far. After that, I&#8217;ll start with work on SymPy&#8217;s matrix expression code generation (the second part of my GSoC project) and pick LFortran up again close to the end of the summer.</p>

						<p>Community bonding period has concluded. Due to my exams and travelling, I was not able to devote much of my time over this. But I managed to review PR #16666 and helped it get merged. With this PR, SymPy comes one step closer to unifying both the Assumption systems. Also, with this I realized how difficult reviewing can be &#128517;.

						<p>So, here I am with another set of experiences to share with you, i.e., the Community Bonding of GSoC. After discussing with my fellow developers, and my mentors, we reframed our timeline. I will be working on very interesting topics in statistics, including, joint distributions, Markov chains, random matrices, assumptions of dependence and simplifying the results of the stats module. For a head start, I started working on adding multivariate distributions and the good news is that I have completed majority of the work, apart from some technical constraints which will be solved by another project very soon. If you are interested in seeing the code, take a look at the PRs #16576, #16808, #16825. Infact, apart from the stats module, I also had an opportunity to work on other modules of SymPy, like, I improved the API of Sum in sympy.concrete, allowing Range to be passed as limits and that too while working on discrete joint distributions. You can check the PR #16810 for the details. Thanks to Christopher Smith for helping me with this. Still there are issues like, #16833 which require a lot of discussion before concrete implementation, will update you on this if some progress takes place. Apart from coding, we had discussions on design of Markov chain and random matrices. I also made two prototypes at PR #16852, and #16866 . We are currently having more to think on this part, like API, class structure, etc. Overall, the bonding period was very a great learning experience about how various modules affect each other and bring the best out of SymPy. See you soon in the next blog. :)

						<h4><strong>Linear Algebra : Tensor Core</strong></h4>



<h3>Overview</h3>



<p style="text-align: left;">After the official announcement of selection result, I was happy to be one of the students to work with <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> over this summer program. A first greeting between the the mentors and me was efficient. Since then, I have been preparing for the launch of the program: creating my personal blog, reading the codebase of SymPy, discussing with my mentors about some details of the proposal, contributing to a new class named ArrayComprehension. Thank to the help of my mentors and other contributors in the community, I understand better the workflow and some coding conventions. Besides, due to the constraint of spare time, I have had some difficulties at the beginning to arrange my timetable. Now I have a more reliable estimation about how many hours I can spend on the program while the college semester is not yet finished. </p>



<h3> Progress regarding the project</h3>



<ul><li>My personal blog</li></ul>



<p>Every student is supposed to maintain a blog on which one should update the progress of each week. I think it is also time for me to create a personal site as an access to introduce myself to the world. I used WordPress as the CMS(Content Management System). I wanted to have a first blog as a global presentation of GSoC, unfortunately I was too busy to do it.<br /></p>



<ul><li>Codebase of Sympy</li></ul>



<p>I have read carefully the code of the Array module and have browsed the entire Tensor module. As for other modules, I only had a look at those that I would probably use in the during this project. By carefully, I would like to say that I tested each method by instantiating an example. Some debuggings were also helpful when I tried to understand the purpose of some codes.</p>



<p>However, I have to admit that I still have a lot of things to learn and to get familiar with. For example, I didn&#8217;t notice the coding convention of the constructor which passes the parameters to superclass in order to make sure the possibility of rebuilding the object. Because if the lack of experience, I may need help and guidance, in the most of time, from other contributors, especially from my mentors.</p>



<ul><li>Discussion of proposal</li></ul>



<p>I have created a documentation in which I specify some detailed questions about my proposal. For example, the NumPy-like syntax was something that I considered working on. But it turns out to be unnecessary to do so. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xsdwz9C38zNoF5MkM29NB0kCZKXvdGJU1oa5VjOVzFc/edit">Doc of questions</a> This documentation will be continuously updated. It can serve as a tract of our discussion and some decisions that we make together. </p>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t have enough time to explore the task like Codegen and Integration over array, I hope that I can have a better view of these tasks before its beginning. After a discussion with me mentors, I can make sure that I have at least a clear understanding of the tasks over phase 1. <br /></p>



<ul><li>ArrayComprehension class</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16845/commits/8effbb6600b7e4cfd7d7f5765dce7ba60ed680dc">#16845</a> This class is not really planned in my proposal, yet it helps me a lot regarding the understanding of the codebase and some coding conventions. Its creation comes from the need of a symbolic list comprehension of two other students in the stats groupe. To be honest, these two students set me a good example during this period. Their dynamicity in contributing to SymPy becomes not only a stress but also an encouragement to me.</p>



<p>For now, the basic structure of ArrayComprehension is established, thanks to the review of Francesco and other contributors in the community. I will continue to working on it so that it would help the students of stats get over the problem.<br /></p>



<h3> Estimation of availability during phase 1 </h3>



<p>After the practice of the past three weeks, I think I found a feasible solution to schedule the work of GSoC and my regular timetable. I have to say that I recently changed the college, this brand-new life gave me as great a challenge as the one of GSoC. Moreover, I have 3 academic projects to do and 4 final exams to prepare. Thus, I would like to reduce my planning working time for the first phase, if I can have the agreement of my mentors. I will make sure the advancement of the project(as it is planned in the proposal), but I cannot be engaged with too much extra work during this period. Once the semester is over, I will make up for the shortage of working hours.<br /></p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>Monday       </td><td>Tuesday       </td><td>Wednesday </td><td>Thursday  </td><td>Friday</td><td>Saturday</td><td>Sunday</td></tr><tr><td>2h<br />22&#65306;00 *- <br />24&#65306;00</td><td>4h<br />20&#65306;00 &#8211;  <br />24&#65306;00</td><td><br />4h<br />20&#65306;00 &#8211;<br />24&#65306;00<br /></td><td>4h<br />20&#65306;00-<br />24&#65306;00</td><td>4h<br />20&#65306;00 &#8211; <br />24&#65306;00</td><td>6h<br />3h + 3h</td><td>6h<br />3h + 3h</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>*Based on UTC+2<br />The average working hours would be 30h per week. Then I will work 50h per week next phase to ensure the 40 hours in average. That is totally possible since I will be on vacation.</p>



<h3>Ameliorations and conclusion</h3>



<p>Since the project will officially start in a very soon future, I would like to propose some possible ameliorations about myself, based on what I have done in the past three weeks.</p>



<ul><li>Be more active in contributing</li></ul>



<p>I have seen the two students in stats sent many PRs and contributed as well in reviewing other&#8217;s PRs. That would be a good example for me to follow. I can surely learn a lot from reviering other&#8217;s code.<br /></p>



<ul><li>Ask well-considered question but don&#8217;t be afraid to say it out</li></ul>



<p>I always want to maintain a good impression of myself to others, which makes me hesitate a lot when I want to ask a question. I think it is better to face the weak points of myself rather than hide it. I am a newbie to the Open Source world, there are surely a lot of things to learn. Please forgive me, Francesco and Sartaj, if my questions seem silly to you.<br /></p>



<ul><li>Prepare for the next phase once it is possible</li></ul>



<p>Due to my constraint of time, I could not prepare very well for the next phase, which makes me worried. It would be good if I can finalize the work of this phase 1 earlier so that I would have some extra time to think about the phase 2 and 3. <br /></p>

<p>The results of <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5688477549592576">Google Summer of Code</a></strong> were out on 06 May 2019 and guess what I got selected and will be working under <strong><a href="http://sympy.org">Sympy</a></strong> for the next 3 months. I will be working on my project, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2019-Application-Divyanshu:-Group-Theory">Group Theory</a>, during this period. I am really excited to work with such an amazing organization. I would like to thank all the mentors especially <a href="https://github.com/jksuom">Kalevi Suominen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/asmeurer">Aaron Meurer</a>, for guiding me in my proposal and PR&#8217;s. The best part is I got my favourite mentor <strong>Kalevi Suominen</strong>.</p>

<p>The first phase is the <em>Community Bonding Period</em>, which has nearly come to an end. In this period I mainly focussed on the following things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Setting up blog and synchronizing it with planet sympy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussing possible means of communication etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planning the implementation of some of the features of the project with Kalevi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Familiarizing with the codebase of <code class="highlighter-rouge">sympy/combinatorics</code> and see how it may help solving the problems while implementing the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting more in-depth theoretical knowledge of the features to be implemented.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Looking forward for a really productive and wonderful summer ahead.</p>

						<p>My first meeting with the GSoC mentors was on Saturday 18th May, 2019 scheduled
between 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (IST). Me, Amit and Yathartha were the attendees of
the meeting. As per the community bonding period the first meeting was meant to
increase the familiarity between me and my mentors and we also discussed about
completing lambert solver. Major points discussed in the meeting are:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Schedule and frequency of meetings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to proceed with completing lambert, understanding existing code and
 writing tests for it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As of now I have looked few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How <code class="highlighter-rouge">lambert</code> works in <code class="highlighter-rouge">bivariate</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How equations are converted to target equation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Filtering out the tests to include all solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will be the flow to fix this problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the previous days I have been understanding the flow of <code class="highlighter-rouge">bivariate</code> along with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">solve</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">solveset</code>. It might take time for me to go through it and arrive
at a good plan but I am trying to learn the art of general aspects of a open
source software. I believe in understanding rather than rushing. The mentors were
very kind and helpfull.</p>

<p>Hope things go as planned!!</p>

						<p>Finally, the result of GSoC-2019 came on 6th of May, 2019. I am very happy to inform that my proposal on improving the assumptions mechanism has been accepted by SymPy for this year&#8217;s GSoC. For those who don&#8217;t know, SymPy is an open-sourced Computer Algebra System(CAS) written in Python. It was started by Ondrej Cetrik(@cetrik) in 2006, as a project. Since 2007, SymPy has participated in Google Summer of Code every year. GSoC has given much boost to the development of SymPy&#8217;s codebase.

						<p>I am very happy to share with you that on 6th May, 2019 I was accepted as a
GSoC student of <a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a>. I would be working on statistics module under the guidance
of my mentors, <a href="https://github.com/Upabjojr">Francesco Bonazzi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sidhantnagpal">Sidhant Nagpal</a>.</p>

<p>I know Francesco since I began contributing to stats module. We had discussions
on various issues like, complicated results by statistics module and inclusion
of stochastic processes in SymPy. I also worked with Sidhant while solving an
issue of wrong PDF of Gumbel distribution. I believe that they both are very great
people to learn from.</p>

<p>I will also work with Ritesh Kumar who has also been accepted to stats module. I
haven&#8217;t interacted with him yet. Let&#8217;s see how we coordinate our work to make this
project a success.</p>

<p>Infact, my first learning experience was using jekyll to set up this blog on github
pages. Since, this was my first usage of jekyll and github pages, I struggled a bit to find
the right resource. If you are also going to use jekyll then I would say, visit <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll">this page</a>.</p>

						<div><p><em>This post has been cross-posted on the <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/04/whats-new-in-sympy-14/">Quansight Blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>As of November, 2018, I have been working at
<a href="https://www.quansight.com/">Quansight</a>. Quansight is a new startup founded by
the same people who started Anaconda, which aims to connect companies and open
source communities, and offers consulting, training, support and mentoring
services. I work under the heading of <a href="https://www.quansight.com/labs">Quansight
Labs</a>. Quansight Labs is a public-benefit
division of Quansight. It provides a home for a "PyData Core Team" which
consists of developers, community managers, designers, and documentation
writers who build open-source technology and grow open-source communities
around all aspects of the AI and Data Science workflow. As a part of this, I
am able to spend a fraction of my time working on SymPy.
<a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a>, for those who do not know, is a
symbolic mathematics library written in pure Python. I am the lead maintainer
of SymPy.</p>
<p>SymPy 1.4 was released on April 9, 2019. In this post, I'd like to go over
some of the highlights for this release. The full release notes for the
release can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-1.4">SymPy
wiki</a>.</p>
<p>To update to SymPy 1.4, use</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">conda install sympy
</code></pre>
<p>or if you prefer to use pip</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install -U sympy
</code></pre>
<p>The SymPy 1.4 release contains over <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-1.4#authors">500 changes from 38 different
submodules</a>,
so I will not be going over every change, but only a few of the main
highlights. A <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-1.4#authors">total of 104
people</a>
contributed to this release, of whom 66 contributed for the first time for
this release.</p>
<p>While I did not personally work on any of the changes listed below (my work
for this release tended to be more invisible, behind the scenes fixes), I did
do the release itself.</p>
<h2>Automatic LaTeX rendering in the Jupyter notebook</h2>
<p>Prior to SymPy 1.4, SymPy expressions in the notebook rendered by default with their
string representation. To get <code>LaTeX</code> output, you had to call <code>init_printing()</code>:</p>
<img alt="SymPy 1.3 rendering in the Jupyter lab notebook" src="https://asmeurer.com/blog/sympy-1.3-notebook.png" />
<p>In SymPy 1.4, SymPy expressions now automatically render as LaTeX in the notebook:</p>
<img alt="SymPy 1.4 rendering in the Jupyter lab notebook" src="https://asmeurer.com/blog/sympy-1.4-notebook.png" />
<p>However, this only applies automatically if the type of an object is a SymPy
expression. For built-in types such as lists or ints, <code>init_printing()</code> is
still required to get LaTeX printing. For example, <code>solve()</code> returns a list,
so does not render as LaTeX unless <code>init_printing()</code> is called:</p>
<img alt="SymPy 1.4 rendering in the Jupyter lab notebook with init_printing()" src="https://asmeurer.com/blog/sympy-1.4-notebook-2.png" />
<p><code>init_printing()</code> is also still needed if you want to change any of the
printing settings, for instance, passing flags to the <code>latex()</code> printer or
selecting a different printer.</p>
<p>If you want the string form of an expression for copy-pasting, you can use
<code>print</code>.</p>
<h2>Improved simplification of relational expressions</h2>
<p>Simplification of relational and piecewise expressions has been improved:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y, z, w = symbols('x y z w')
&gt;&gt;&gt; init_printing()
&gt;&gt;&gt; expr = And(Eq(x,y), x &gt;= y, w &lt; y, y &gt;= z, z &lt; y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; expr
x = y &#8743; x &#8805; y &#8743; y &#8805; z &#8743; w &lt; y &#8743; z &lt; y
&gt;&gt;&gt; simplify(expr)
x = y &#8743; y &gt; Max(w, z)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; expr = Piecewise((x*y, And(x &gt;= y, Eq(y, 0))), (x - 1, Eq(x, 1)), (0, True))
&gt;&gt;&gt; expr
&#9127; x&#8901;y   for y = 0 &#8743; x &#8805; y
&#9130;
&#9128;x - 1      for x = 1
&#9130;
&#9129;  0        otherwise
&gt;&gt;&gt; simplify(expr)
0
</code></pre>
<h2>Improved MathML printing</h2>
<p>The MathML presentation printer has been greatly improved, putting it on par
with the existing Unicode and LaTeX pretty printers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; mathml(Integral(exp(-x**2), (x, -oo, oo)), 'presentation')
&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msubsup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;#x222B;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;-&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x221E;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&amp;#x221E;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msubsup&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;&amp;ExponentialE;&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mo&gt;-&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;dd;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If your <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mathml">browser supports MathML</a> (at the
time of writing, only Firefox and Safari), you should see the above
presentation form for <code>Integral(exp(-x**2), (x, -oo, oo))</code> below:</p>
<p><math style="display: block;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msubsup><mo>&#8747;</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>&#8734;</mi></mrow><mi>&#8734;</mi></msubsup><msup><mi>&#8519;</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msup><mo>&#8518;</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></math></p>
<h2>Improvements to solvers</h2>
<p>Several improvements have been made to the solvers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; eq = Eq((x**2 - 7*x + 11)**(x**2 - 13*x + 42), 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; eq
                2
               x  - 13&#8901;x + 42
&#9115; 2           &#9118;
&#9117;x  - 7&#8901;x + 11&#9120;               = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve(eq, x) # In SymPy 1.3, this only gave the partial solution [2, 5, 6, 7]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>The ODE solver, <code>dsolve</code>, has also seen some improvements. Two new hints have
been added.</p>
<p><code>'nth_algebraic'</code> solves ODEs using <code>solve</code> by inverting the derivatives
algebraically:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Function('f')
&gt;&gt;&gt; eq = Eq(f(x) * (f(x).diff(x)**2 - 1), 0)

<h2>Dropping Python 3.4 support</h2>
<p>This is the last release of SymPy to support Python 3.4. SymPy 1.4 supports
Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and PyPy. What's perhaps more exciting is that
the next release of SymPy, 1.5, which will be released later this year, will
be the last version to support Python 2.7.</p>
<p>Our
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Python-version-support-policy">policy</a> is
to drop support for major Python versions when they reach their <a href="https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches">End of
Life</a>. In other words,
they receive no further support from the core Python team. Python 3.4 reached
its end of life on May 19 of this year, and Python 2.7 will reach its end of
life on January 1, 2020.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/moving-away-from-python-2/">blogged in the
past</a> on why I
believe it is important for library authors to be proactive in dropping Python
2 support, and since then <a href="https://python3statement.org">a large number of Python
libraries</a> have either dropped support or
announced their plans to by 2020.</p>
<p>Having Python 2 support removed will not only allow us to remove a <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/sympy-1.4/sympy/core/compatibility.py">large
amount of compatibility
cruft</a>
from our codebase, it will also allow us to use some Python 3-only features
that will clean up our API, such as <a href="https://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python3_advanced.html#keyword-only-arguments">keyword-only
arguments</a>,
<a href="https://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python3_features.html#function-annotations">type
hints</a>,
and <a href="https://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python3_features.html#unicode-variable-names">Unicode variable
names</a>.
It will also enable <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Dropping+Python+2%22">several internal
changes</a>
that will not be visible to end-users, but which will result in a much cleaner
and more maintainable codebase.</p>
<p>If you are still using Python 2, I strongly recommend switching to Python 3,
as otherwise the entire ecosystem of Python libraries is soon going to stop
improving for you. Python 3 is already highly recommended for SymPy usage due
to several key improvements. In particular, in Python 3, division of two
Python <code>int</code>s like <code>1/2</code> produces the float <code>0.5</code>. In Python 2, it does
integer division (producing <code>1/2 == 0</code>). The Python 2 integer division
behavior can lead to very surprising results when using SymPy (imagine writing
<code>x**2 + 1/2*x + 2</code> and having the <code>x</code> term "disappear"). When using SymPy, we
<a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/gotchas.html#two-final-notes-and">recommend</a>
using rational numbers (like <code>Rational(1, 2)</code>) and avoiding <code>int/int</code>, but the
Python 3 behavior will at least maintain a mathematically correct result if
you do not do this. SymPy is also <a href="https://speed.python.org/comparison/?exe=12%2BL%2Bmaster%2C12%2BL%2B3.5%2C12%2BL%2B3.6%2C12%2BL%2B2.7&amp;ben=666%2C667%2C669%2C668&amp;env=1%2C2&amp;hor=false&amp;bas=none&amp;chart=normal+bars">already faster in Python
3</a>
due to things like <code>math.gcd</code> and <code>functools.lru_cache</code> being written in C,
and general performance improvements in the interpreter itself.</p>
<h2>And much more</h2>
<p>These are only a few of the highlights of the hundreds of changes in this
release. The full release notes can be found on <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-1.4">our
wiki</a>. The wiki
also has the in progress changes for our next release, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-1.5">SymPy
1.5</a>, which will be
released later this year. Our <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot">bot</a>
automatically collects release notes from every pull request, meaning SymPy
releases have very comprehensive and readable release notes pages. If you see
any mistakes on either page, feel free to edit the wiki and fix them.</p></div>

    <p>these two papers on reading sucked the hell out of me (probably because I don&#8217;t

  <li>
    <p>I&#8217;d a go through the lecture 7 (skipped the lectures 4, 5 and 6), to get an idea
  of what are deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow (lecuture 7 is an introduction to it).
  It gives a basic idea of why to use Tensorflow and performing basic operations with
  it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all this weekend was all focused on things related to NLP stuff. I am hopeful
  that in the next year I might be able to take a few more step towards learning
  the NLP stuff.</p>

						<div><p>GitHub recently announced its <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-08-28-announcing-paper-cuts/">paper cuts
initiative</a> to fix
minor issues that make things more difficult for GitHub users. As someone who
spends most of his day on <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>, this initiative is
great, as these small cuts can quickly add up to a painful experience.</p>
<p>The initiative has already made some great fixes, such as <a href="https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-07-31-unselectable-diff-markers/">making the diff
markers
unselectable</a>
and
<a href="https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-10-08-issue-and-pull-request-hovercards/">hovercards</a>.
Small changes like these are usually quite easy for GitHub to do, but they
make a huge difference to those of use who use GitHub every day.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/1034528642389266432">recently asked</a>
how these cuts could be reported to GitHub for fixing, but got no response. So
I am writing this blog post.</p>
<p>To be very clear: I think that on the whole GitHub is great and they are doing
a great job. And it's still better than the alternatives (to put things in
perspective, I recently spent <a href="https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/1029158262069899266">half an
hour</a> trying to
figure out how to change my password in BitBucket, and GitLab can't even keep
me logged in between sessions). GitHub has and continues to revolutionize the
open source ecosystem, and is still the best place to host an open source
project.</p>
<p>But since GitHub did
<a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-08-28-announcing-paper-cuts/">ask</a> what sorts of
changes they want to see, I'm providing a list. In this post I'm trying to
only ask about things that are small changes (though I realize many won't be
as easy to fix as they may appear from the outside, and I readily admit that I
am not a web developer).</p>
<p>These are just the things that have bothered me, personally. Other people use
GitHub differently and no doubt have their own pain points. For instance, I
have no suggestions about the project boards feature of GitHub because I don't
use it. If you are also a GitHub user and have your own pain points feel free
to use the comment box below (though I have no idea if GitHub will actually
see them).</p>
<p>If you work for GitHub and have any questions, feel free to comment below, or
<a href="mailto:asmeurer@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow anyone to add labels to issues.</strong> At the very least, allow the
person who opened the issue to add labels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new issue transfer ability is great, but please <strong>make it require only
push access, not admin access.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remove the automatic hiding of comments when there are too many.</strong> I
understand this is done for technical reasons, but it breaks
Cmd-F/scrolling through the page to find comments. Often I go to an issue
trying to find an old comment and can't because buried in the comments is a
button I have to press to actually show the comment (it's even worse when
you have to find and press the button multiple times).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better indication for cross-referenced pull requests.</strong> I really don't
know how to fix this, only that it is a problem. It happens all the time
that a new contributor comes to a SymPy issue and asks if it has been
worked on yet. They generally do not seem to notice the cross-referenced
pull requests in the list.
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14943">Here</a> is an example of what
I'm talking about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indicate better if a cross-referenced pull request would close an
issue.</strong> Preferably with text, not just an icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTML pull request/issue templates.</strong> I don't know if this counts as a
"cut", as it isn't a simple fix. Right now, many projects use pull
requests/new issue templates, but it is not very user friendly. The problem
is that the whole thing is done in plain text, often with the template text
as an HTML comment to prevent it from appearing in the final issue text.
Even for me, I often find this quite difficult to read through, but for new
contributors, we often find that they don't read it at all. Sure there's no
way to force people to read, but if we could instead create a very simple
HTML form for people to fill out, it would be much more friendly, even to
experienced people like myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fix the back button in Chrome.</strong> I don't know if this is something that
GitHub can fix, and I also do not know how things work in other browsers. I
use Chrome on macOS. Often, when I click the "back" button and it takes me
back to an issue page, the contents of the page are out-of-date (the newest
comments or commits do not appear). It's often even more out-of-date than
it was when I left the page. I have to reload the page to get the latest
content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow Markdown formatting in issue titles.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show people's names next to comments as "Real Name (@username)".</strong> In
general, GitHub should be emphasizing people's display names rather than
their usernames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remember my selection for the "sort" setting in the issues list.</strong> I'd
love to have issues/pull requests sort by "most recently updated" by
default, so that I don't miss updates to old issues/pull requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make advanced search filters more accessible.</strong> They should autofill,
similar to how Gmail or even GitLab search works (yes, please steal all
the good ideas from GitLab; they already stole all their good ideas from
you).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tone down the reaction emojis.</strong> Maybe this ship has sailed, but
reaction emojis are way too unprofessional for some projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy/paste text as Markdown.</strong> For example, copying "<strong>bold</strong>" and
pasting it into the comment box would paste <code>**bold**</code>. Another idea that
you can steal from GitLab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strike out #12345 issue links when the issue/PR is closed/merged</strong>
(like <strike>#12345</strike>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pull requests</h3>
<ol start="15">
<li>
<p><strong>Add a button that automatically merges a pull request as soon as all the
CI checks pass.</strong> Any additional commits pushed to the branch in the
interim would cancel it, and it should also be cancellable by someone else
with push access or the PR author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add some way to disable the automatic hiding of large diffs.</strong> This
breaks Cmd-F on the page, and makes it harder to scroll through the pull
request to find what you are looking for (typically the most important
changes are the ones that are hidden!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Include all issue/PR authors in the authors search on the pull request
list page.</strong> Right now it only lists people with push access. But I
generally can't remember people's GitHub usernames, and autofilling based
on all authors would be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better contextual guesses for issue autofilling (after typing <code>#</code>).</strong>
For instance, if an issue has already been referenced or cross-referenced,
it should appear near the top of the list. We have almost <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues">3000 open
issues</a> in SymPy, and the current
issue numbers are 5-digits long, so referencing an issue purely by number
is very error prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-update edited comments.</strong> Context: SymPy uses a
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot">bot</a> that comments on every pull
request, requiring a release notes entry to be added to the description.
This works quite well, but to prevent the bot from spamming, we have it
comment only once, and edit its comment on any further checks. However,
these edits do not automatically update, so people have to manually reload
the page to see them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't hide full commit messages by default in the commits view.</strong> It
would be better to encourage people to write good commit messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make issue cross-references in pull request titles work.</strong> I'd rather
people didn't put issue numbers in pull request titles but they do it
anyway, so it would be nice if they actually worked as links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow me to comment on lines that aren't visible by default.</strong> That is,
lines that you have to click the "expand" icon above or below the line
numbers to access. As an example, this can be useful to point out a line
that should have been changed but wasn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying code from a diff that includes lines that aren't visible by
default includes an extra space to the left for those lines.</strong> This is a
straight up bug. Probably fixing the previous point would also fix this :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make searches include text from the pull request diff.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a diff indents a line color the whitespace to the left of the
line.</strong> (see
<a href="https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/740611970714480640">this</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull requests can show commits that are already in master.</strong> For
example, if someone makes pull request B based off of pull request A and
then A gets merged, B will still show the commits from A. This has been a
bug forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make the "jump to file or symbol" popdown collapsible.</strong> Specifically
what I mean is I want to be able to show just the files, without any
symbols. For large pull requests, it is very difficult to use this popdown
if there are hundreds of symbols. I typically want to just jump to a
specific file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The status check on the favicon goes away when you switch to the diff
tab.</strong> Kudos to Marius Gedminas for <a href="https://twitter.com/mgedmin/status/1058381090694553601">pointing this
out</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/15280#issuecomment-426795606">Apparently</a>
status checks that use the GitHub Apps API are forced to link into the
checks tab.</strong> The checks tab is useless if no information is actually
published to it. It would be better if it could link straight to the
external site, like is done with oauth integrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make it easier to copy someone's username from the pull request page.</strong>
I generally do this to <code>git remote add</code> them (using
<a href="https://github.com/github/hub">hub</a>). If I try to select their username
from a comment, it's a link, which makes it hard to select. I generally
copy it from the blue text at the top "<em>user</em> wants to merge <em>n</em> commits
from <code>sympy:master</code> from <code>user:branch</code>". If it were easier to select
"user" or "branch" from that box (say, by double clicking), that would be
helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change the "resolve conversation" UI.</strong> I keep pressing it on accident
because it's where I expect the "new comment" button to be.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/github-reviews-gripes/">whole
post</a> about the
reviews feature when it came out. Not much has changed since then (actually,
it has gotten worse). In short, the feature doesn't work like I would like it
too, and I find the default behavior of deferred comments to be extremely
detrimental. If there were a way to completely disable reviews (for myself, I
don't care about other people using the feature), I would.</p>
<p>See my blog post for full details on why I think the reviews feature is broken
and actually makes things worse, not better than before. I've summarized a few
things that could change below.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>
<p><strong>Make reviews non-deferred by default.</strong> This is the biggest thing. If I
had to pick only a single item on this page to be changed, it would be
this. The issue is if I start a review and walk away from it, but forget
to "finalize" it with a review status, the review is never actually seen
by anyone. The simplest way to fix this would be to simply make partial
reviews public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make Cmd-Enter default to immediate comment.</strong> Barring the above change,
Cmd-Enter on a pull request line comment should default to immediate
comment, not deferred (review) comment. The problem with the
Cmd-Shift-Enter shortcut is that it is inconsistent: on a normal comment,
it closes the pull request, and on a reply comment, it does nothing. I
shouldn't have to check what "comment context" I am in to figure out what
keyboard shortcut to use. The worst part is if you accidentally start a
review, it's a pain in the ass to undo that and just post a normal
comment. The simplest way to fix this would be to swap the current meaning
of Cmd-Enter and Cmd-Shift-Enter for line comments (and no, this wouldn't
be a backwards incompatible change, it would be a regression fix;
Cmd-Enter <em>used</em> to do the right thing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow reviewing your own pull request.</strong> There's no reason to disallow
this, and it would often be quite useful to, for instance, mark a work in
progress PR as such with a "request changes" review. Obviously
self-reviews would be excluded from any required reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unhide the reviews box.</strong> It should just be the same box as the comment
box, unstead of buried on the diff tab (see my <a href="https://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/github-reviews-gripes/">blog
post</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show review status in the pull request list as a red X or green check.</strong>
This would make it easier to see which pull requests have reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow new commits to invalidate reviews.</strong> That way they work the same
way as any other status check. (I see that this is now an option for
required reviews, which is new since my original blog post, but it still
doesn't affect the status as reported on the pull requests list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow requiring zero negative reviews to merge (but not necessarily any
positive reviews)</strong>. Requiring a positive review is pointless. The person
merging can just add one real quick before they merge, but it is
unnecessary extra work. On the other hand allowing people with push access
to block a merge with a negative review would be very useful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Web editor</h3>
<ol start="39">
<li>
<p><strong>The web editor seems to have a search function, but I can't get it to
actually work.</strong> Half the time Cmd-F pops open the browser search, which
doesn't find text that isn't on screen. And when I press Cmd-G to actually
do the search, it doesn't work (and there are no buttons to perform the
search either).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add basic syntax testing in the web editor for common languages to catch
basic mistakes.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Mobile site</h3>
<ol start="41">
<li>
<p><strong>Please make the mobile site work with iOS 10.</strong> I don't see any reason
why simple things like buttons (like the merge button or the comment
button) shouldn't work on a slightly older browser. No, I am not a web
developer, but I do use my phone a lot and I've noticed that literally
every other website works just fine on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add a way to disable the mobile site permanently.</strong> For the most part,
the mobile site is useless (see below). If you aren't going to put full
development effort into it, allow me to disable it permanently so that
every time I visit <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> on my phone it goes to
the desktop site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Seeing as how the site (mobile or not) is almost completely unusable on every
mobile device I own, it's hard to list other things here, but based on back
when it actually worked, these are some of the things that annoyed me the
most. Basically, I have found that virtually every time I go to GitHub to do
anything on mobile, I have to switch to desktop mode to actually do what I
want.</p>
<p>My apologies if any of these actually work now: as I said,
<a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> doesn't actually work at all on my phone.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>
<p><strong>Cannot search issues on mobile.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cannot make a line comment that <em>isn't</em> a review on mobile.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cannot view lines beyond the default diff in pull requests on mobile.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show more than 2 lines of the README and 0 lines of the code by default
on project pages.</strong> Yes mobile screens are small but it's also not hard to
scroll on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support Jupyter notebook rendering on mobile.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Files view</h3>
<ol start="48">
<li>
<p><strong>GitHub needs a better default color theme for syntax highlighting.</strong>
Most of the colors are very similar to one another and hard to
differentiate. Also things like strings are black, even though one of the
most useful aspects of syntax highlighting generally is to indicate
whether something is in a string or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add MathJax support to markdown files.</strong> This would be amazingly useful
for SymPy, as well as many scientific software projects. Right now if you
want this you have to use a Jupyter notebook. MathJax support in
issue/pull request comments would be awesome as well, though I'm not
holding out for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add "display source" button for markdown, ReST, etc.</strong> I mean the button
that is already there for Jupyter notebooks. Right now you have to view
markdown and ReST files "raw" or edit the file to see their source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add a link to the pull request in the blame view.</strong> Usually I want to
find the pull request that produced a change, not just the commit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Wiki</h3>
<ol start="52">
<li>
<p><strong>The wikis used to support LaTeX math with MathJax. It would be great if
this were re-added.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The ability to set push permissions for the wiki separately from the
repo it is attached to, or otherwise create an oauth token that can only
push to the wiki would be useful.</strong> Context: for SymPy, we use a
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot">bot</a> that automatically updates our
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes">release notes</a> on our
wiki. It works quite well, but the only way it can push to the wiki is if
we give it push access to the full repo.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notification emails</h3>
<ol start="54">
<li>
<p><strong>Don't clobber special emails/email headers.</strong> GitHub adds special emails
like <a href="mailto:author@noreply.github.com">author@noreply.github.com</a> and
<a href="mailto:mention@noreply.github.com">mention@noreply.github.com</a> to email
notifications based on how the notification was triggered. This is useful,
as I can create an email filter for
<a href="mailto:author@noreply.github.com">author@noreply.github.com</a> for
notifications on issues and pull requests created by me. The bad news is,
<a href="mailto:mention@noreply.github.com">mention@noreply.github.com</a>, which is
added when I am @mentioned, clobbers
<a href="mailto:author@noreply.github.com">author@noreply.github.com</a>, so that it
doesn't appear anymore. In other words, as soon as someone @mentions me in
one of my issues, I become <em>less</em> likely to see it, because it no longer
gets my label (I get @mentioned on <em>a lot</em> of issues and don't have the
ability to read all of my notification emails). Ditto for the
<code>X-GitHub-Reason</code> email headers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Readd the "view issue" links in Gmail.</strong> (I forgot what these are
called). GitHub notification emails used to have these useful "view issue"
buttons that showed up on the right in the email list in Gmail, but they
were removed for some reason.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>API</h3>
<ol start="56">
<li>
<p><strong>Make the requests in the API docs actually return what they show in the
docs.</strong> This means the <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/">example
repo</a> should have actual example
issues corresponding to what is shown in the docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow giving deploy key access to just one branch.</strong> That way I can have
a deploy key for <code>gh-pages</code> and minimize the attack surface that the
existence of that key produces. I think everyone would agree that more
fine-grained permissions throughout the API would be nice, but this is one
that would benefit me personally, specifically for my project
<a href="https://drdoctr.github.io/">doctr</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
<p>GitHub pages is one of the best features of GitHub, and in fact, this very
blog is hosted on it. Very few complaints here, because for the most part, it
"just works".</p>
<ol start="58">
<li>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/831962312122761216"><strong>Moar themes.</strong></a>
Also it's awesome that you can use any GitHub repo as a theme now, but it
turns out most random themes you find around GitHub don't actually work
very well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The steps to add HTTPS to an existing GitHub pages custom domain are a
bit confusing.</strong>. This took us a while to figure out for
<a href="https://sympy.org">sympy.org</a>. To get things to work, you have to trigger
GitHub to issue a cert for the domain. But the UI to issue the cert is to
paste the domain into the box. So if the domain is already there but it
doesn't work, you have to re-enter it. Also if you want both www and the
apex domain to be HTTPS you have to enter them both in the box to trigger
GitHub to issue a cert. This is primarily a UX issue. See
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy.github.com/issues/105#issuecomment-415899934">https://github.com/sympy/sympy.github.com/issues/105#issuecomment-415899934</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ol start="60">
<li>
<p><strong>Automatically protected branches make the branch difficult to delete
when you are done with it.</strong> My use-case is to create a branch for a
release, which I want to protect, but I also want to delete the branch
once it is merged. I can protect the branch automatically pretty easily,
but then I have to go and delete the protection rule when it's merged to
delete it. There are several ways this could be fixed. For instance, you
could add a rule to allow protected branches to be deleted if they are
up-to-date with default branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add a way to disable the ability for non-admins to create new branches
on a repo.</strong> We want all of our pull requests to come from forks. Branches
in the repo just create confusion, for instance, they appear whenever
someone clones the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Related to the previous point, make pull request reverts come from
forks.</strong> Right now when someone uses the revert pull request button, it
creates a new branch in the same repo, but it would be better if the
branch were made in the person's fork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow me to enable branch protection by default for new repos.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allow me to enable branch protection by default on new branches.</strong> This
is more important than the previous one because of the feature that lets
people push to your branch on a pull request (which is a great feature by
the way).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clicking a team name in the settings should default to the "members"
tab.</strong> I don't understand why GitHub has a non-open "discussions" feature,
but I find it to be completely useless, and generally see such things as
harmful for open source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suggest people to add push access to.</strong> I don't necessarily mean
passively (though that could be interesting too), but I mean in the page
to add someone, it would be nice if the popup suggested or indicated which
people had contributed the project before, since just searching for a name
searches all of GitHub, and I don't want to accidentally give access to
the wrong person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<ol start="67">
<li>
<p><strong>Stop trying to make profile pages look "cute" with randomly highlighted
pull requests.</strong> GitHub should have learned by now that profile pages
matter a lot (whether people want them to or not), and there can be
unintended consequences to the things that are put on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain what the axes actually mean in the new "activity overview".</strong>
I'm referring to
<a href="https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/1033141923630874624">this</a> (it's
still in beta and you have to manually enable it on your profile page).
Personally I'm leaving the feature off because I don't like being
metricized/gamified, but if you're going to have it, at least include some
transparency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<ol start="69">
<li><strong>Allow hiding the "source code (zip)" and "source code (tar.gz)" files in
a release.</strong> We upload our actual release files (generated by <code>setup.py</code>)
to the GitHub release. We want people to download those, not snapshots of
the repo.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ol start="70">
<li>
<p><strong>The repository search function doesn't support partial matches.</strong> This
is annoying for <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/">conda-forge</a>. For
instance, if I <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=png&amp;type=&amp;language=">search for
"png"</a>
it doesn't show the
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/libpng-feedstock">libpng-feedstock</a> repo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show commit history as a graph.</strong> Like <code>git log --graph</code>. This would go
a <em>long</em> way to helping new users understand git. When I first started
with git, understanding the history as a graph was a major part of me
finally grokking how it worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bring back the old "fork" UI.</strong> The one that just had icons for all the
repos, and the icons didn't go away or become harder to find if you
already had a fork. Some of us use the "fork" button to go to our
pre-existing forks, not just to perform a fork action. This was recently
changed and now it's better than it was, but I still don't see why
existing forks need to be harder to find, visually, than nonexisting ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide a more official way to request fixes to these cuts.</strong> I often
ask on Twitter, but get no response. Preferably something public so that
others could vote on them (but I understand if you don't want too much
bikeshedding).</p>

                    <p>If you are a SymPy contributor you can have your blog on Planet SymPy. Blog content can be SymPy/SymEngine/SciPy/Python themed, English language and not liable to offend. If you have a general blog you may want to set up a tag and subscribe the feed for that tag only to Planet SymPy.</p>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is kept in GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy">here</a>. If you have an account you can add or edit your own feed: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>git clone git@github.com:sympy/planet-sympy.git</em>
                        </li>

                        <li>Put your hackergotchi in <em>website/hackergotchi/</em>. A hackergotchi should be a photo of your face smaller than 80x80 pixels with a transparent background. <em>git add</em> the file.</li>

                        <li>At the end of the <em>planetsympy/config</em> file add your details (the name in brackets is your GitHub handle):</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you do not have a GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy/issues/new">file an issue in the issue tracker</a> listing your name, GitHub account (if you have one), RSS or Atom feed. Attach a photo of your face for hackergotchi.</p>

                    <h2>Planet SymPy Guidelines</h2>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is one of the public faces of the SymPy project and is read by many users and potential contributors. The content aggregated at Planet SymPy is the opinions of its authors, but the sum of that content gives an impression of the project. Please keep in mind the following guidelines for your blog content and read the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">SymPy Code of Conduct</a>. The SymPy project reserves the right to remove an inappropriate blog from the Planet.</p>

                    <h3>Blogs should be SymPy themed</h3>

                    <p>The majority of content in your blog should be about SymPy and your work on SymPy. The blog can also be about anything that interests SymPy community, for example, scientific computing, language syntax and semantics, etc. Blog posts about personal subjects are also encouraged since Planet SymPy is a chance to learn more about the developers behind SymPy. However blog feeds should not be entirely personal, if in doubt set up a tag for Planet SymPy and subscribe the feed from that tag so you can control what gets posted.</p>

                    <h3>Posts should be constructive</h3>

                    <p>Posts can be positive and promote SymPy, they can be constructive and lay out issues which need to be addressed, but blog feeds should not contain useless, destructive and negative material. Constructive criticism is welcome and the occasional rant is understandable, but a feed where every post is critical and negative is unsuitable. This helps to keep SymPy overall a happy project.</p>

                    <h3>You must be a SymPy contributor</h3>

                    <p>Only have your blog on Planet SymPy if you actively contribute to SymPy, for example through code, user support, documentation etc.</p>

                    <h3>It must be a personal blog, or in a blog class</h3>

                    <p>Planet SymPy is a collection of blogs from SymPy contributors.</p>

                    <h3>Do not inflame</h3>

                    <p>SymPy covers a wide variety of people and cultures. Profanities, prejudice, lewd comments and content likely to offend are to be avoided. Do not make personal attacks or attacks against other projects on your blog.</p>

                    <p>For further guidance on good practice see the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">SymPy Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
