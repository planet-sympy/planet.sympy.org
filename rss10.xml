      <description>&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Hi there! It&amp;#8217;s been six weeks into the coding period, and it marks the half of GSoC.&amp;#160;The Midterm evaluations have been done now and I have passed the mid-term evaluations. I am very much thankful to my mentors. This week I was having some physical illness due to this reason I was not able to attend the meeting with my mentors. This affected my workflow too. I was not able to work for almost 3 days. I will try to compensate&amp;#160;the time lag by working some extra hours in the upcoming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Until last week, I have completed the implementation of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;PointLoad&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;and &amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;DistributedLoad.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;This week I started implementing the class for&amp;#160;the principle object of the Beam Bending problems. I have implemented the Beam class. The work is not completed yet. I have initiated the class with &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Young&amp;#8217;s Modulus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moment of Inertia.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;I have to discuss with the mentor about the mutability of this class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BoundaryConditions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;:- It is a public method of the beam class which takes the boundary conditions of the beam bending problem as input. I found out that there are only three types of boundary conditions : Deflection, Shear and Moment. So, I made them input in the form of keyword arguments and for each key, the value would be a list of tuples where each of the tuples would contain location and value in this format : (location, value). This method returns the boundary conditions in the form of a python dictionary. For example: &amp;#160;Let a problem have boundary conditions as: Moment(x = 0) = 1, Deflection(x = 0) = 0,&amp;#160;Deflection(x = 4) = 0. Then the API is:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.physics.mechanics.beam import Beam
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy import Symbol
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; E = Symbol('E')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I = Symbol('I')
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b = Beam(4, E, I)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b.BoundaryConditions(moment = [(0, 1)], deflection = [(0, 0), (4, 0)])
{'deflection': &lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(0, 0), (4, 0)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;, 'moment': &lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(0, 1)]}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will try to get&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11178"&gt;PR 11178 &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11237"&gt;PR 11237&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the Beam class with new methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all for this week. Cheers !!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/sampadblog.wordpress.com/688/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/sampadblog.wordpress.com/688/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=sampadblog.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=102728326&amp;#038;post=688&amp;#038;subd=sampadblog&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
First of all the good news, I have &lt;i&gt;passed&lt;/i&gt; the mid-term evaluations.
I received the feedback from Kalevi, "I have had some problems with the blog posts.".
Though Kalevi, mentioned to not take the post seriously.
Well, not to say, that is definitely true. I don't claim that I will be
able to remedy this, but lets see what happens.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kalevi, had sent me a mail, mentioning "next things to do", it included
"Cosets in Permuations group" and "Finitely Presented Abelian groups".
(its been quite sometime since that mail).
It was more of my decision to implement the topic of "presentation of subroups".
To be true, I particularly chose this topic, since that makes the output
of out work done till now, to look beautiful :) . Earlier I had a constant doubts
when I was making proposal about what it exactly means by "presentation of subgroups".
So while I read the examples from the Handbook, it became clear to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to the progress in the topic, here's what we have done, I opened the PR on sunday.
This week we started with the implementation of subgroup presentations. There are
two methods to compute "presentation of a subgroup", first being called
"computing presentations on schreier generators" also called the Reidemeister Schreier
procedure. Since we have already implemented the "Todd Coxeter"
procedure, which is used as the first step in Reidemeister Schreier for coset
enumeration. It uses a routine which is called "define_schreier_generators",
Second being "computing presentation on the generators of subgroup".
Well the pseudo code is there for both the two implementations. The code of
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The important part of finding the "presentation of subgroup" being simplifying
the "presentations", i.e reducing the three factors |X| (no. of subgroup generators),
|R| (no. of subgroup relators) and l (total length of subgroup relators). Though
there doesn't seem to any pseudo code available anywhere for the implementation (this makes
it quite interesting to implement). But the paper by Havas [Reidemeister Schreier program]
(http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/havas/1974h.pdf) neatly explains the things.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Last 2 days were spent on trying to make "elimination_technique_1" work. Its still not
fully functional, since it still returns some dependent relators as a part of the presentation.

As for an example, currently Reidemeister Schreier procedure presentation works this way.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; F, x, y = free_group("x, y")
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = FpGroup(F, [x**2*y**2, y**-1*x*y*x**-3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; H = [x]
&gt;&gt;&gt; reidemeister_presentation(f, H)
([x_1], [x_1**-4, x_1**-8])

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Two things need to be fixed here. First being, removal of -ve powers of single syllable
relators, $x_1^{-4}$ -&gt; $x_1^4$, similarly for the other relator.
Second thing being, since $x_1^4 = 0$ implies that $x_1^8 = 0$ (dependent relator) so the relator
should be removed. Perhaps the issue with this is, where should the code for checking this dependence
be introduced? Kalevi seems a bit busy these days with other project. That is not the issue. I believe there may be
something more to the simplification in the "Handbook", (have been referring to [2] for the
elimination of generators, relators and simplification of presentations).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I Thought of focussing on a new topic "simplification of presentations", the method
is short descripted in [2], but that is sufficient enough. It starts by checking whether any relator
is of the form $gen^n$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$. If any such relators are found then all other relators
are processed for strings in the $gen$ known order. All string length exceeding length $n/2$ are
replaced by their shortest equivalent. Further, for even `n` strings gen$^{-n/2}$ replaced by
gen$^{n/2}$. I have written its code, perhaps it only requires a few more tests to be added
to it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think I will be busy with "presentation of subgroups", this week and next week as well.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hi everyone. Here's a brief summary of 5th week of my GSoC.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the 5th week we worked upon the implementation of Low Index Subgroups algorithm.
The basic problem dealt with by this algorithm is:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;find all subgroups H
such that the index $|G:H|$ is at most a specified number $N &gt; 0$.
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The term
"low" is used to indicate the impracticalness of solving the problem for large
$N$ values. The Handbook [1] contains the necessary pseudo code for its
implementation, in which it has been explained in a top-down approch instead
of the usual bottom-up approach.

Complexity of the algorithm: exponential.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Status update: completion of Low Index Subgroup algorithm.
The main function for calling the algorithm is &lt;code&gt;low_index_subgroups&lt;/code&gt; with signature &lt;code&gt;(G, N, Y=[])&lt;/code&gt;, here $G$ is the group for which we want to find the subgroups for, $N$ being a positive integer specifying the upper bound on the index value of subgroup generated, and $Y$ is optional argument specifying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This routine also (&lt;code&gt;coset_enumeration_c&lt;/code&gt; to needed this) makes use of calling &lt;i&gt;cyclic conjugates&lt;/i&gt; of cyclic reductions of a set of relators, so I made a method in &lt;code&gt;CosetTable&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;conjugates&lt;/code&gt;, which does this task now. We have a list $S$, which stores the coset tables for the founds subgroups. The algorithm later calls a routine called &lt;code&gt;descendant_subgroups&lt;/code&gt;. One of the things being that in &lt;code&gt;low_index_subgroups&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;descendant_subgroups&lt;/code&gt; routine can be called on any of the generators of inverse of generator of group $G$, though this isn't clear in the Handbook, but I some intuition to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

descendant_subgroups($C$, $\{R_{1x}^C \}$, $R_2$, $N$)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
try_descendant($C$, $\{R_{1x}^C\}$, $R_2$, $N$, $\alpha$, $x$, $\beta$)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is an example of Low Index Subgroup algorithm in work, Yay :) !!

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy.combinatorics.free_group import free_group
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy.combinatorics.fp_groups import FpGroup, low_index_subgroups
&gt;&gt;&gt; F, x, y = free_group("x, y")
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = FpGroup(F, [x**2, y**3, (x*y)**4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; L = low_index_subgroups(f, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in L:
...     print(i.table)

[[0, 0, 0, 0]]
[[0, 0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 0], [3, 3, 0, 1], [2, 2, 3, 3]]
[[0, 0, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1]]
[[0, 0, 1, 2], [3, 3, 2, 0], [4, 4, 0, 1], [1, 1, 5, 4], [2, 2, 3, 5], [5, 5, 4, 3]]
[[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]]
[[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 3], [4, 4, 3, 1], [5, 5, 1, 2], [2, 2, 5, 6], [3, 3, 6, 4], [7, 7, 4, 5], [6, 6, 7, 7]]
[[1, 1, 1, 2], [0, 0, 2, 0], [3, 3, 0, 1], [2, 2, 4, 5], [5, 5, 5, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4]]
[[1, 1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 4, 5], [5, 5, 3, 0], [4, 4, 0, 2], [3, 3, 5, 1], [2, 2, 1, 4]]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Things I would love to have for this algorithm is to give, a presentation in the form Magma gives the subgroup returned in the form of generators of subgroup. That is coding the &lt;b&gt;Reidemeister Schreier&lt;/b&gt; and its variant algorithms.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Logo" src="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/static/img/summer-of-code-logo.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I had been working on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials_over_finite_fields#Distinct-degree_factorization"&gt;distinct degree factorization&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/995"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; PR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinct degree factorization splits a square-free polynomial into a product of polynomials whose irreducible factors all have the same degree.
&lt;br /&gt;Suppose we have a polynomial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;x**15 - 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we do distinct degree factorization of it, we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;x**5 + 10
x**10 + x**5 + 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the results consist of product of some polynomials with equal degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;x**5 + 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is product of polynomials of degree 1, while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;x**10 + x**5 + 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is product of polynomials of degree 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factorization is achieved by exploiting the fact that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lemma" src="http://i.imgur.com/N9zZW26.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for every degree &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; less than half of polynomial&amp;#8217;s degree, we find the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt; of above computed polynomial and the given polynomial. If it&amp;#8217;s not one, we add it to existing list of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have to find its equal degree factorization, I have implemented it and I am testing it with different cases.
It will run on every input provided from distinct-degree factorization, and break it into polynomials with equal degrees.
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently I am implementing Cantor-Zassenhaus&amp;#8217;s algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re halfway there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past two weeks were supposed to be for implementing Matrices. But as I mentioned in the previous post, things got complicated with evalf methods, and I could not start working on the Matrices. This week &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/987" target="_blank"&gt;PR #987&lt;/a&gt; was merged up for evalf CWrappers. (The spec for the Ruby Wrapper needs some changes, which I have kept aside for now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SymEngine, matrices are of two forms, the DenseMatrix and the SparseMatrix. I have implemented the following constructors for them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new()
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(SymEngine::DenseMatrix)
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(Array)
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(no_rows, no_columns)

mat = SymEngine::SparseMatrix.new()
mat = SymEngine::SparseMatrix.new(no_rows, no_columns)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, for the DenseMatrix, the following methods were wrapped:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;DenseMatrix.get(row, col)
DenseMatrix.set(row, col, SymEngine::Basic)
DenseMatrix.inv
DenseMatrix.det
DenseMatrix.transpose
DenseMatrix.submatrix(row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end, row_step, col_step)
DenseMatrix.rows
DenseMatrix.cols
+ operator for Matrix and Scalar addition
* operator for Matrix and Scalar addition
DenseMatrix.to_s
DenseMatrix.inspect&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon to be wrapped are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;DenseMatrix.LU
DenseMatrix.LDLDenseMatrix.LU_solve # (to solve Ax = B type equations with LU decomposition)
DenseMatrix.FFLU # (fraction free LU)
DenseMatrix.FFLDU # (fraction free LDU)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work can be views at &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/992" target="_blank"&gt;PR #992&lt;/a&gt; at symengine repo and &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb/pull/56" target="_blank"&gt;PR #56&lt;/a&gt; at symengine.rb repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was really nice for me in getting significant parts of the Matrices done,and with the luck continuing I will be able to wrap the necessary methods for SparseMatrix, get done with the tests and finish the Matrix part within the coming week, putting me back in track with the time-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/rajithsays.wordpress.com/318/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/rajithsays.wordpress.com/318/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rajithsays.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=110498904&amp;#038;post=318&amp;#038;subd=rajithsays&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I continued my work on the method to convert a given Holonomic Function to Hypergeometric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some major bugs that produced wrong results because of the fact that the recurrence relation doesn&amp;#8217;t holds for all non-negative &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. So I changed it to also store the value, say &lt;code&gt;n0&lt;/code&gt;, so the recurrence holds for all &lt;code&gt;n &amp;gt;=n0&lt;/code&gt;. I changed the method &lt;code&gt;.to_hyper()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;accordingly and it works pretty fine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added the method to convert to symbolic expressions &lt;code&gt;to_sympy()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;. It uses &lt;code&gt;hyperexpand&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;, however will only work for cases when a &lt;code&gt;hyper&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;representation is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were implemented at&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11246"&gt;[#11246]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I have been majorly working on some issues Ondrej pointed out.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue nonlinsolve :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111"&gt;#11111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed the dependency of old solvers &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_invert&lt;/code&gt;. It was basically helpful for removing &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; or Rational power.
Now using &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;unrad&lt;/code&gt; and little changes in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;substitution&lt;/code&gt; function can handle the system havning &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;cube root&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue - Diophantine in Solveset :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234"&gt;11234&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some points we discussed :&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Solveset&lt;/code&gt; should return all the solution, so we need to check for which kind of eq. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diophantine&lt;/code&gt; returns all
  the solution. We can get the equation type using &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;classify_diop&lt;/code&gt; defined in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diophantine.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If there is the case where &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diophantine&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t return all the solutions then just return &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ConditionSet&lt;/code&gt; or try to
  make all solution (e.g. if just need to permute sign in values then use &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;permute_signs&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading the &lt;a href="http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/solvers/diophantine.html"&gt;diophantine Documentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diophantine&lt;/code&gt; doctests and examples, I found that :&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Currently, following five types of Diophantine equations can be solved using &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;~sympy.solvers.diophantine.diophantine&lt;/code&gt; and other helper functions of the Diophantine module.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Linear Diophantine equations:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... + an*xn = b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;General binary quadratic equation:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Homogeneous ternary quadratic equation:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dxy + eyz + fzx = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Extended Pythagorean equation:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;a_{1} * x_{1}^2 + a_{2} * x_{2}^2 + ....  + a_{n} * x_{n}^2 = a_{n+1} * x_{n+1}^2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;General sum of squares:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2 + ... + x_{n}^2 = k&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If I am correct then &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Diophantine&lt;/code&gt; returns all the soln if eq is Linear Diophantine equations, General binary quadratic equation and Homogeneous ternary quadratic equation. I tried some Linear Diophantine equations and cross checked with online Diophantine solvers(one of the solver is &lt;a href="http://www.numbertheory.org/php/main_pell.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In last 2 (Extended Pythagorean equation and General sum of squares) we need to do &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;permute_signs&lt;/code&gt; to get all the soln.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;E.g.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ```
      &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.utilities.iterables import permute_signs
      &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; list(permute_signs((1, 12)))
      [(1, 12), (-1, 12), (1, -12), (-1, -12)]

  ```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In general if all variables have even powers then we should do &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;permute_signs&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Diophantine&lt;/code&gt; solves the factors of the eq
  so if we have eq like this &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x**2 - y**2&lt;/code&gt;, diophantine solves factors &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x + y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x - y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ```

    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diophantine
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
    set([(-t_0, -t_0), (t_0, -t_0)])

  ```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;so we should check even powers and permute sign.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;other examples :&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diop_general_sum_of_squares
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.abc import a, b, c, d, e, f
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; diop_general_sum_of_squares(a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + d**2 + e**2 - 2345)
set([(15, 22, 22, 24, 24)])

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diop_general_pythagorean
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; diop_general_pythagorean(a**2 + b**2 + c**2 - d**2)
(m1**2 + m2**2 - m3**2, 2*m1*m3, 2*m2*m3, m1**2 + m2**2 + m3**2)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; diop_general_pythagorean(9*a**2 - 4*b**2 + 16*c**2 + 25*d**2 + e**2)
(10*m1**2  + 10*m2**2  + 10*m3**2 - 10*m4**2, 15*m1**2  + 15*m2**2  
  + 15*m3**2  + 15*m4**2, 15*m1*m4, 12*m2*m4, 60*m3*m4)

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diop_general_sum_of_even_powers
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; diop_general_sum_of_even_powers(a**4 + b**4 - (2**4 + 3**4))
set([(2, 3)])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In above these types of cases we need &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;permute_signs&lt;/code&gt;. If we check these solution you can see that &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;permute_signs&lt;/code&gt;
  is needed when solutions is not parameterized.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;e.g.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diophantine
  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from sympy.abc import x, y, z
  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
  set([(-t_0, -t_0), (t_0, -t_0)])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;solution &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;set([(-t_0, -t_0), (t_0, -t_0)])&lt;/code&gt; is same as &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;set([(-t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0), (-t_0, t_0), (t_0, -t_0)])&lt;/code&gt;.(because &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;t_0&lt;/code&gt; can take any integer value.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I discussed these things with &lt;a href="https://github.com/thilinarmtb"&gt;@thilinarmtb&lt;/a&gt; (He have worked on &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diophantine&lt;/code&gt;. Blog link : &lt;a href="https://thilinaatsympy.wordpress.com/page/2/"&gt;https://thilinaatsympy.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;). Main points are :&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Only the linear solver is incomplete, the algorithm in Diophantine module should be fixed (`permute_signs` or something like that won't help). We can use `permute_signs` when we have even powers in all variables. We should update Diophantine module to use permute sign. But we should not returns `ConditionSet` for linear diophantine eq. because for linear diophantine eq `diophantine()`returns parameterized solution which is complete most of the time.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;classify_diop&lt;/code&gt; can returns these &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diop_type&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;linear&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;univariate&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;binary_quadratic&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;inhomogeneous_ternary_quadratic&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;homogeneous_ternary_quadratic_normal&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;homogeneous_ternary_quadratic&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;inhomogeneous_general_quadratic&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;inhomogeneous_general_quadratic&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;homogeneous_general_quadratic&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;general_sum_of_squares&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;general_pythagorean&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;cubic_thue&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;general_sum_of_even_powers&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If the equation type is none of these then &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solveset_integers&lt;/code&gt; should returns &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ConditionSet&lt;/code&gt;.Because currently &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;diophantine&lt;/code&gt;
   can handle these kinds of eq only.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PR Update diophantine to get some missing solution: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11334"&gt;11334&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue simplified Trigonometric eq solution :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shifted the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_union_simplify&lt;/code&gt; function code to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_union&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fancyset/ImageSet&lt;/code&gt; with some changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;continue&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Basic To Poly</title>
      <author>Srajan Garg (srajangarg)</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my week was mostly consumed by asking questions like &amp;#8220;Should this throw?&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;What are it&amp;#8217;s generators?&amp;#8221;. My work for this week was to make a mechanism for converting arbitrary expression into polynomials. Turns out, it isn&amp;#8217;t as trivial as it initially sounded. I will discuss my progress below. This week has been a lot more of logic involved, and thinking about how to go ahead instead of just development, so I do not have a lot to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-idea"&gt;The Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multivariate polynomial is made of generators. A univariate polynomial is made of a single generator. Each term in a polynomial is a monomial which is multiplication of it&amp;#8217;s generators to a non-negative power, which also has a non-zero coefficient multiplied to it. Here are some polynomials and their generators :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;x**2 + x**5          		-&amp;gt;      x

sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)**3        -&amp;gt;		sqrt(3)

(1/x**2) + (1/x**5) 		-&amp;gt; 		(1/x)

x**2 + y**2 + x				-&amp;gt; 		x, y

2**x + 1					-&amp;gt; 		2**x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you get the idea. The main task is given a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt;, we need to construct a polynomial with appropriate generator. The task is broken down into two parts. First off, we try and extract a generator from the given expression. Secondly, use the found (or user given) generator to construct the polynomial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally the API should look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RCP&amp;lt;Basic&amp;gt; UIntPoly::from_basic(Basic x);
RCP&amp;lt;Basic&amp;gt; UIntPoly::from_basic(Basic x, Basic gen);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="my-progress"&gt;My Progress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only worked on the univariate polynomial class as of now, and was to write the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;from_basic&lt;/code&gt; method just for the univariate classes for now. Although I just had to deal with the specific case of univariate integer polynomials, I haven&amp;#8217;t successfully been able to get the job done just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work started with converting &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Symbol var&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Basic var&lt;/code&gt;. Initially, the generators of the polynomial class could only be symbols, however this needed to be changed, as we&amp;#8217;ve seen generators can be anything! This change did not take a lot of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;find_gen&lt;/code&gt; function which given a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; will try and find a unique generator for the polynomial to be constructed. Ideally, if no generator/ more than one generator is found it will throw a runtime error. I covered most of the cases but a few still remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, an initial implementation of the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;to_poly&lt;/code&gt; functionality has been done, complete with the required API. Some cases related to conversion still need to be handled. I do not want to go into the logic involved into each conversion as it is tedious and not very structured. All the work done till now can be seen in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/998"&gt;#998&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope with all the information I have gained over this week, I will wind up the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UPoly&lt;/code&gt; conversions for both the integer coefficients as well as the general expression coefficients by the end of next week. I also intend to make the logic more concrete, so that the same API can be used in the multivariate case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miscellaneous-work"&gt;Miscellaneous Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made some changes in the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;expand&lt;/code&gt; function related to polynomials. They mostly have to deal with removal of code, which has already been implemented. It is also a partial fix for &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/issues/886"&gt;#886&lt;/a&gt;, work is in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/999"&gt;#999&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tata!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! It&amp;#8217;s been five weeks and midterm evaluations are going on. I have completed the implementations of Singularity Function module and headed towards the Implementation of Beam Bending Module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In PR&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11266"&gt;11266&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;, I have implemented three major classes :
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DistributedLoad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; : Have the attributes &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. This object can be used to generate a distributed load. It is a mutable object. The&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;start &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;end &lt;/em&gt;attribute should be the instance of mechanics Point. The value can take any function as input. This Load can be represented as a Singularity&amp;#160;Function (i have not implemented this functionality yet) and used for solving the beam bending problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PointLoad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; : There are two types : Moment and Point Load. Moments are basically the couple of forces and are represented by the Doublet function whereas Point Load is the force which acts on a single unique point of the Beam and is represented as a DiracDelta Function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; : It is the principle object of the Beam Bending problems. I have started working on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I started this week off by getting sick and as such productivity took a
little bit of a hit. The majority of this week was spent reading Featherstone&amp;#8217;s
text book. The example documentation showcasing the base class API still hasn&amp;#8217;t
been reviewed and so that part of the project will just have to be set aside
until later. Overall the project will not suffer, however, because of my
progress in learning Featherstone&amp;#8217;s method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done a couple of other things this week as well. In a discussion with
Jason it was determined that the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt; class must have access to
the dynamic system&amp;#8217;s bodies through the Lagrangian input. Upon research the
Lagrangain turned out to not be an object instance but rather a function that
simply returned the Lagrangian for input bodies. This meant that
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt; did not in fact have access to the dynamic system&amp;#8217;s bodies.
Due to this I decided that an easy way to get &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt; to have body
information would be to add an optional keyword argument for it. This was
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt; can have a more similar API to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt;. This change can
be found in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11263"&gt;PR #11263&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I reviewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10856"&gt;PR #10856&lt;/a&gt;
which claimed to fix &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/10855"&gt;Issue
#10855&lt;/a&gt;. Upon review it seemed
that the &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; was to just not run tests that were failing. When researched it
looks like a whole module has not been updated for Python 3.X and is failing
its relative imports. When run in Python 2.X it&amp;#8217;s still not working either but
rather is throwing up many &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KeyError&lt;/code&gt; flags. I think this has not been caught
sooner due to the module being a component directly dealing with another
project (pyglet) thus the tests are not run by TravisCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly there were some test errors in the example documentation for the base
class on PyDy. I was not too worried about these because the PR is not
currently awaiting merging and is simply a discussion PR. The failing tests,
however, were not related to the changes in the PR and so a PyDy member
submitted a PR that fixed the tests and asked me to review it. After I looked
it over and determined that the fix addressed the issue correctly he merged the
PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="future-directions"&gt;Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I plan to continue forward with reading Featherstone&amp;#8217;s book and, if
possible, begin implementing one of the methods outlined in the book. Also I
plan on beginning work on mirroring Jason&amp;#8217;s overhaul of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt; on
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prs-and-issues"&gt;PR&amp;#8217;s and Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks were spent of developing heuristics for determining the
fundamental period of a given trigonometric function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our higher school, we all must have come across &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Trigonometric Functions&lt;/code&gt;.
One of the most striking properties of these functions is their periodicty.&lt;br /&gt;
The ability of a function to repeat its values in regular intervals has always
caught my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, SymPy ought to have a functionality to determine the period of a function.
The instigated me to implement this function now was the build failure in my 
PR#11141 on &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_decomposition&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="issue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;function_range(sin(x), x, domain=S.Reals)&lt;/code&gt; causes the build to time-out as the 
number of critical points of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt; in the entire real domain is infinite.
The same goes for other trigonometric functions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we can set the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt; argument to be a finite interval which 
encompasses the entire behaviour of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt; over the entire real domain, our 
issue can be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led me to the idea of using the periodicity of the function as its domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f = sin(x) + sin(2*x) + cos(3*x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the period of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;2&amp;#8901;&amp;#960;&lt;/code&gt; 
i.e. the LCM of the periods of individual function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is known !&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, in order to find the period of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, we need the functionality to determine
the period simpler trigonometric functions such as &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sin(2*x)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;cos(3*x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="property"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the period of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;g(x)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, then the period of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;g(a*x)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;T/a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this property, we can easily compute the periods of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sin(2*x)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;cos(3*x)&lt;/code&gt;
with our knowledge of the periodicity of the fundamental trigonometric functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue- nonlinsolve :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111"&gt;#11111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found the case where complex solution is missed. When &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_poly_system&lt;/code&gt; is solving polynomial equation and that result is used
in solving non polynomial-equation to get other soln. May be &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_poly_system&lt;/code&gt; return only real solution( so complex solution is not being used for further steps) thats why further step is with this real solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_poly_system&lt;/code&gt; is doing it&amp;#8217;s job since it is not designed for all solution. But we have &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;substitution&lt;/code&gt; method using
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solveset_real&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solveset_complex&lt;/code&gt; and retuning all solutionn. In new commits I improved the code and now &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;substitution&lt;/code&gt; method can solve all kind of system independently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I come across these kind of situation many times :&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;In [68]: x, y, z, r, t = symbols('x, y, z, r, t', real = True)

In [69]: soln = solveset(sqrt(r)*Abs(tan(t))/sqrt(tan(t)**2 + 1) + x*tan(t),x,S.Reals)

In [70]: soln
Out[70]:
          &amp;#9127;      &amp;#8730;r&amp;#8901;&amp;#9474;tan(t)&amp;#9474;      &amp;#9131;
(-&amp;#8734;, &amp;#8734;) &amp;#8745; &amp;#9130;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9130;
          &amp;#9128;   _____________       &amp;#9132;
          &amp;#9130;  &amp;#9585;    2               &amp;#9130;
          &amp;#9129;&amp;#9586;&amp;#9585;  tan (t) + 1 &amp;#8901;tan(t)&amp;#9133;

In [71]: soln = solveset(sqrt(r)*Abs(tan(t))/sqrt(tan(t)**2 + 1) + x*tan(t),x)

In [72]: soln
Out[72]:
&amp;#9127;     -&amp;#8730;r&amp;#8901;&amp;#9474;tan(t)&amp;#9474;      &amp;#9131;
&amp;#9130;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9472;&amp;#9130;
&amp;#9128;   _____________       &amp;#9132;
&amp;#9130;  &amp;#9585;    2               &amp;#9130;
&amp;#9129;&amp;#9586;&amp;#9585;  tan (t) + 1 &amp;#8901;tan(t)&amp;#9133;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;In [1]: Intersection(FiniteSet(-x), S.Reals)
Out[1]: (-&amp;#8734;, &amp;#8734;) &amp;#8745; {x}

In [2]: Intersection(FiniteSet(x), S.Reals)
Out[2]: &amp;#8477; &amp;#8745; {x}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am not able to extract the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; here. Because of this &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nonlinsolve&lt;/code&gt; returning some extra soln.
One case is in test file : &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;test_issue_5132&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened a PR for this &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11280"&gt;#11280&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If someone wants to see the changes I did in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nonlinsolve&lt;/code&gt; then check these gist &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/Shekharrajak/5e77fe344c996c17c177985853884985"&gt;nonlinsolve_till_24june_2016&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/Shekharrajak/5d285ce0cf113cfc217c3e33c3ca04c0"&gt;nonlinsolve_till_21jun2016.py&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;previous PRs update :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188"&gt;#11188&lt;/a&gt; - Simplified Solution for Trigonometric equation :
 I did some minor changes.Now I hope it is good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234"&gt;#11234&lt;/a&gt; - Connecting Diophantine and solveset to get Integer solution:
added some testcases. I have defined &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solveset_integers&lt;/code&gt; for this, it take take list of symbols(to get soln in that order).t
But Currently solveset takes one symbol. I hope this PR is good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11257"&gt;11257&lt;/a&gt; - solveset univariate trig inequality solvers : Actually to simplify the
soln I need to use PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188"&gt;#11188&lt;/a&gt;, so if it got merged that code will help me in this PR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I worked on these previous PRs regarding issues I reported &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11239"&gt;#11239&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11280"&gt;11280&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Logo" src="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/static/img/summer-of-code-logo.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/955"&gt;Initial Implementation of Finitefield&lt;/a&gt; got merged. It will allow us to represent polynomial with integral coefficients in finite field.
Talking about the design, we are sticking to the dense representation, i.e. the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;dict_&lt;/code&gt; is a vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week there was an error in &lt;a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/"&gt;Appveyor&lt;/a&gt; build, I had no idea how to fix this. I tried to print with every passed test case and use &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;-VV&lt;/code&gt; option for verbose mode, but it was of no use.
Isuru, then told me that I have to log into the Appveyor&amp;#8217;s VM and debug it. He helped with &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;remmina&lt;/code&gt; and we found that there was problem in the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_istrip()&lt;/code&gt; function, where I was erasing elements using iterators, but after any insertion or deletion iterators become invalid. So, it is better to use indices, or do re-assignment of iterators there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I started working on square free algorithms. In mathematics, a square-free polynomial is a polynomial defined over a field that is not a multiple of the square of a non unit factor. In general terms, they can be thought as a polynomial with no repeated roots.
And square free factorization is the first step towards factorization of polynomials in finite field.
So, I have implemented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C++"&gt;GaloisFieldDict gf_diff() const;
bool gf_is_sqf() const;
std::vector&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;GaloisFieldDict, integer_class&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gf_sqf_list() const;
GaloisFieldDict gf_sqf_part() const;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_diff&lt;/code&gt; differentiates the polynomial in the given field.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_is_sqf&lt;/code&gt; returns whether polynomial is squarefield in the given field.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_sqf_part&lt;/code&gt; returns the square free part of the polynomaial in the given field.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_sqf_list&lt;/code&gt; returns the square free decomposition of polynomial&amp;#8217;s monic representation in the given field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This PR has also been merged. Currently I am working on Distinct Degree factorization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
            Hi everyone.
          &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            Here is a brief summary of what we did in the second and third week of GSoC.
          &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;First of all I got late in blogging about our progress for the weeks 2, 3. Since the internet connection was disrupted(&lt;a href="https://gxyd.github.io/feeds/quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat_reservation_agitation"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt;) for almost 3 weeks in my city, so in between I had to move out to some other place. But still project progress is good :)
                    &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
Status update:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gxyd.github.io/feeds/quot;https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11140"&gt;PR #11140&lt;/a&gt; on implementation of strategies of coset enumeration has been &lt;i&gt;merged&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We implemented the &lt;i&gt;Coset Enumeration&lt;/i&gt; strategies. Suppose $G$ is defined by a finite presentation, and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ (for $H$ we currently only list of generators which generate $H$), which is specified by words in the generators of $G$ that generate $H$. The procedure is known as coset enumeration and is one of the most fundamental methods in CGT. No algorithm (its been proved mathematically [4]) can be guaranteed to terminate for &lt;i&gt;coset enumeration&lt;/i&gt;, so it can't be defined to have a fixed complexity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Coset Table&lt;/i&gt; is equivalent to the permutation representation of the input group $G$ in its action by right multiplication on the right cosets of $H$. Beginning with the &lt;code&gt;Coset Table&lt;/code&gt;, we have initialised it with various attributes in &lt;i&gt;SymPy&lt;/i&gt;, most of them are instances of &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, they are appended on the way while strategies like &lt;i&gt;HLT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Felsch&lt;/i&gt; run over it. Contrary to what I mentioned in my last post, &lt;code&gt;CosetTable&lt;/code&gt; is not a subclass of &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The algorithm we have implemented is known as &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://gxyd.github.io/feeds/quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%E2%80%93Coxeter_algorithm"&gt;Todd-Coxeter algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. The algorithm can use too much memory and time, but still memory is more important resource than time in this algorithm. This algorithm has got two major implementations:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;HLT strategy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this strategy whenever we use the C.scan_and_fill($\alpha$, $w$) for scanning the word $w$ over coset $\alpha$, routine for scanning which if the scan is incomplete makes a new definition of coset using &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; then we make new definitions to enable the scan to complete; that is, we fill in the gaps in the scan of the relator or subgroup generator. Kalevi suggested to make some modification from the original pseudo-code, which resulted in quite a few improvements, since the changes removes un-necessary scanning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For calculating the index of $x^{-1}$, for a generator $x$, we initialised the Coset Table with a dictionary &lt;code&gt;A_dict_inv&lt;/code&gt;, which has &lt;code&gt;(gen,index)&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;(key,value)&lt;/code&gt; pair.
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x, index in self.A_dict.items():
...     if index % 2 == 0:
...         self.A_dict_inv[x] = self.A_dict[x] + 1
...     else:
...         self.A_dict_inv[x] = self.A_dict[x] - 1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We changed the slicing of the Free Group elements, which now work this way.
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = x**2*y**6
&gt;&gt;&gt; w[1]
x
&gt;&gt;&gt; w[3]
y
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since earlier it was only possible using the &lt;code&gt;.subword(i, i+1)&lt;/code&gt; to obtain the $i_{th}$ "word".
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
                        We have now completed the &lt;a href="https://gxyd.github.io/feeds/quot;https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11140"&gt;PR #11140&lt;/a&gt;
            We used the utf-8 encoding in &lt;code&gt;sympy/combinatorics/fp_groups.py&lt;/code&gt; in its comments, which was generating the error in &lt;code&gt;Python2.7&lt;/code&gt; but not in &lt;code&gt;Python3.4&lt;/code&gt;
                        &lt;code&gt;
                        &lt;pre&gt;
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xce' in file /home/gaurav/Public/sympy/sympy/combinatorics/fp_groups.py
on line 79, but no encoding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details
                        &lt;/pre&gt;
                        &lt;/code&gt;
                        and then using the line &lt;code&gt;# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-&lt;/code&gt; at the top of file resolved the issue, so seems like &lt;code&gt;Python2.x&lt;/code&gt; is more sensitive to such issues.
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;There was one error in the implemted code:
                        &lt;code&gt;
                        &lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy.combinatorics.free_group import free_group
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy.combinatorics.fp_groups import FpGroup, coset_enumeration_r, CosetTable
&gt;&gt;&gt; F, x, y = free_group("x, y")
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = FpGroup(F, [x**2, y**3, (x*y)**3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; Y = [x*y]
&gt;&gt;&gt; C = coset_enumeration_r(f, Y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.table # this will return the table
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
                        As for refinement, I will paste another one.
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# these are the steps that happen internally
&gt;&gt;&gt; C = CosetTable(f, Y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.scan_and_fill(0, x*y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.scan_and_fill(0, x**2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.scan_and_fill(0, y**3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.scan_and_fill(0, (x*y)**3)
# till now coset table is fine.
# here the coset table returned is wrong.
                        &lt;/pre&gt;
                        &lt;/code&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        In the implementation of &lt;code&gt;scan_and_fill&lt;/code&gt; the implemened code differed from that in the book in one significant aspect. In the book, &lt;code&gt;scan_and_fill&lt;/code&gt; looped until it filled the $\alpha$ row in the table. ("Made a new definition and continue with scan."). While the implemented code returned after one definition, the error occured since I tried removing the while loop (some testing purpose). Then we also added some "examples" from [2].
                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Felsch strategy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this we first find the first undefined coset $\alpha$, in this instead of seeing ahead by making use of &lt;code&gt;lookahead&lt;/code&gt;, we make &lt;b&gt;deductions&lt;/b&gt;, which are put in a &lt;code&gt;deduction_stack&lt;/code&gt; (a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; instance which behaves a &lt;i&gt;stack&lt;/i&gt;), which contains the pair $(\alpha, x)$, whenever a new &lt;b&gt;definition&lt;/b&gt; or a &lt;b&gt;deduction&lt;/b&gt; is made, this reduces the number of un-necessary cosets made (loweing the memory use at the cost of time).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we have made use of &lt;code&gt;CosetTableDefaultMaxLimit = 409600&lt;/code&gt; (similar to that in &lt;i&gt;GAP&lt;/i&gt;), till now I haven't found a single example which would exhaust this much memory in our implementation, every one just seems to take too much of time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Python utilities learned on the way:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At one point we had to make a list of generator and inverse of generators of a finitely presented groups i.e &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; for a &lt;code&gt;CosetTable&lt;/code&gt;, I did a bit of searching a arrived at using the &lt;a href="https://gxyd.github.io/feeds/quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable"&gt;&lt;code&gt;chain.from_iterable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;itertools&lt;/code&gt; which works as follows:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import chain
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(chain.from_iterable((x**2, x**3) for x in range(4)))
[0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 8, 9, 27]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Use of &lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; routine, since in &lt;code&gt;coset enumeration&lt;/code&gt;, we often iterate over  $w \in Y$ and $x \in A$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
In &lt;code&gt;Python2.x&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; instance doesn't have a &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; attribute, so &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; function or &lt;i&gt;slicing&lt;/i&gt; is used to make a shallow copy. [3]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


                    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the post, here's one awesome small example of &lt;code&gt;coset enumeration&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;i&gt;HLT&lt;/i&gt; strategy. Here is how the code works!! :)

                    &lt;p&gt;
                    My mentor, Kalevi, has been very much supportive, when I informed him about my possible abscence (due to internet unavailability), he even sent me a mail about the &lt;i&gt;things we could do next&lt;/i&gt;, even if I am offline.
                    So here they are: Cosets in Permutation Groups, Finitely presented abelian groups.

      <title>GSoC Week 4 Progress</title>
      <author>Rajith Vidanaarachchi (rajithv)</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 18:10:16 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://rajithsays.wordpress.com/2016/06/19/gsoc-week-4-progress/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As week #4 comes to an end, the headway I made last week was lost, with lots of memory related errors. But in terms of experience it was quite a good week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, some loose ends of &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb/pull/51" target="_blank"&gt;PR #51&lt;/a&gt; in symengine.rb was tied up and it was merged, fully completing the FunctionSymbol functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, as I explained in the previous blogpost, the evaluation methods were implemented. The method &amp;#8216;evalf&amp;#8217; provides a single point to evaluate floating point values of mathematics expressions (real &amp;amp; complex), at a given precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I was contributing code directly to the SymEngine&amp;#8217;s C++ code. The coding part was pretty much straight-forward, as the method required only to get the expression to be evaluated, the precision needed, and whether it was a real number or not. Using these information, the evaluation was to be forwarded to eval_double, eval_mpfr, eval_complex_double or eval_mpc. But some memory leaks were present, costing me quite a lot of time to localize the errors and to rectify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, except for a certain case in the cwrapper tests, everything seems to be working fine, and the work can be checked out under &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/987" target="_blank"&gt;PR #987&lt;/a&gt; in symengine, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb/pull/55" target="_blank"&gt;PR #55&lt;/a&gt; in symengine.rb repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, during this week I was checking out the possible implementation of matrices for the Ruby Wrappers. I decided to interface SymEngine matrices to NMatrix through the Ruby API. So, for the starters I will be going ahead with the SymEngine::DenseMatrix class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ruby, I plan to implement the following ways of implementing the DenseMatrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new()
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(SymEngine::DenseMatrix)
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(NMatrix)
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(Array)
mat = SymEngine::DenseMatrix.new(no_rows, no_columns)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the coding work, last week&amp;#8217;s code reviews were an interesting part of the learning experience. I was reviewing code of Gaurav &amp;#8211; another SciRuby GSoCer, who is also writing Ruby wrappers. Looking at his code and hearing what he had to tell about mine was quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week, hopefully with better news on the SymEngine matrices!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/rajithsays.wordpress.com/305/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/rajithsays.wordpress.com/305/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rajithsays.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=110498904&amp;#038;post=305&amp;#038;subd=rajithsays&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <title>GSoC Week 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on two things since my last blog post and they are: converting Symbolic Functions/Expressions to Holonomic and converting Holonomic to Hypergeometric. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the former first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a method for converting Expressions earlier too, but that was very trivial, so this week began by me writing a Look-Up table technique to convert expressions. It is similar to the way &lt;code&gt;meijerint._rewrite1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;converts to &lt;code&gt;meijerg&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;in the&amp;#160;&lt;code&gt;integrals&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;module. The method recursively searches for chunks in the expression that can be converted to Holonomic (using tables) and then uses the operation &lt;code&gt;+, *, ^&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;defined on Holonomic Functions to convert the whole expression.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11222" target="_blank"&gt;#11222&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started working on to write a method that converts Holonomic Functions to Hypergeometric or a linear combination of them. (if it&amp;#8217;s possible, because every Holonomic Functions is not Hypergeometric.) First I asked questions I had to&amp;#160;Kalevi on Gitter about how to do it, and then finally wrote the code here&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11246" target="_blank"&gt;#11246&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me also give you an overview of things we have in the module so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differential Operators and Recurrence Operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holonomic Functions with following operations: addition, multiplication, power, integration and composition).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing Recurrence relation in Taylor coefficients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series expansion using the recurrence. (Some know issues are there if origin is a regular singular point.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerical Computation (Runge-Kutta 4th Order and Euler&amp;#8217;s method.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting to Hypergeometric. (Currently working on this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting Hypergeometric to Holonomic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting Meijer G-function to Holonomic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting expressions to Holonomic. (There doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a direct algorithm for converting algebraic functions which are not polynomials or rationals, so they are not supported right now.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I will be continuing my work on converting to &lt;code&gt;hyper&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;and then further extending it to convert to expressions using &lt;code&gt;hyperexpand&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good&amp;#160;luck to all fellow GSoCers&amp;#160;for Midterm Evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/shubhamtibra.wordpress.com/347/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/shubhamtibra.wordpress.com/347/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=shubhamtibra.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=106149936&amp;#038;post=347&amp;#038;subd=shubhamtibra&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <title>Polynomial Functionalities</title>
      <author>Srajan Garg (srajangarg)</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://srajangarg.github.io//2016/06/19/Polynomial-Functionality/</link>
      <description>&lt;h3 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last week was spent on adding more functionality to all the three types of Integer Polynomials in SymEngine. Which meant that I had to basically wrap methods already existing in Piranha and Flint, and write new methods for the SymEngine polynomials to provide the required functionality. Details about said functions and the problems faced while implementing them are described in the rest of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this Saturday, some friends and I decided to visit the hill station of Lonavala for the day. It was a replenishing experience, and a break from the regular routine. Here&amp;#8217;s us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://srajangarg.github.io/assets/lonavala.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="functions"&gt;Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to start off by adding a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;div_upoly&lt;/code&gt; functions for dividing two univariate polynomials. It is obvious that division of two polynomials with integer coefficients may very well result in polynomials with rational coefficients. But a rational polynomial class does not exist. So what does it mean to divide two univariate polynomials and get a integer polynomial quotient and remainder? The domain &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ZZ[x]&lt;/code&gt; is not a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain"&gt;Euclidean Domain&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we mean by Euclidean division,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Two polynomials p, q can uniquely be written as
p = quo * q + rem 
deg(rem) &amp;lt; deg(q) or rem = 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the euclidean division that we are so familiar with is not defined for this domain. So how do other libraries handle this division? I tried the division with Flint, Sage and SymPy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;In [14]: q = Poly(2*x)
In [15]: p = Poly(5*x**2)
In [16]: div(p, q, domain=ZZ)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flint and Sage gave :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;quo = Poly(2*x, x, domain='ZZ') 
rem = Poly(x**2, x, domain='ZZ')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while SymPy gave :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;quo = Poly(0, x, domain='ZZ') 
rem = Poly(5*x**2, x, domain='ZZ')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was interesting, as SymPy gave a different answer than the other two. I asked about this behaviour on gitter, and had a brief explanation given by &lt;a href="https://github.com/jksuom"&gt;@jksuom&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operation &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;quo_rem&lt;/code&gt; is mathematically well defined only in so-called Euclidean domains. They are principal ideal domains (PIDs) equipped with a &amp;#8216;Euclidean function. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ZZ[x]&lt;/code&gt; is not a PID, so there is no universal agreement on how &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;quo_rem&lt;/code&gt; should be defined. I think that there are some appealing features in the way it is defined in sage, but one cannot say that SymPy&amp;#8217;s way would be wrong, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems that the main (only?) practical use of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;quo_rem&lt;/code&gt; in non-Euclidean domains is for testing if an element is divisible by another. That happens when the remainder vanishes. Both ways of defining &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;quo_rem&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ZZ[x]&lt;/code&gt; can be used to decide this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explanation made a lot of sense, but I was anyways asked to open up &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11240"&gt;#11240&lt;/a&gt;, to know why SymPy handled division the way it did, and if it could be changed. Taking in all the inputs, I decided that I should not go ahead with a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;div_upoly&lt;/code&gt; function for now, instead I made a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;divides_upoly&lt;/code&gt; function which basically tells wether a polynomial divides the other or not. I had to implement the straight forward algorithm in SymEngine, while Flint already had a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;divides&lt;/code&gt; function and Piranha throws an exception on inexact division,  which I used to port it for Piranha polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other methods which were wrapped were &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;lcm&lt;/code&gt; for both the Flint and the Piranha polynomials. I have not been able to write these functions for SymEngine polynomials yet. The most trivial algorithms for finding GCD of two univariate polynomials depends on euclidean division, and that does not exist in the integer ring polynomials. Some more information from &lt;a href="https://github.com/jksuom"&gt;@jksuom&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ring &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ZZ[x]&lt;/code&gt; is a unique factorization domain (UFD) even if it is not euclidean. It has &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;lcm&lt;/code&gt;, but there is no euclidean algorithm for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isuru suggested a hint for a simple algorithm, but I have not been able to follow it up yet. I&amp;#8217;ll catch up with it in the coming week. The next function I worked on was &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt;. Again this was already implemented in the two other libraries and I just had to wrap them. For SymEngine, I had to decide which algorithm to use, a naive repeated approach or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring"&gt;exponention by squaring&lt;/a&gt; algorithm. I also benchmarked the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt; methods of Piranha too. All the work and the benchmarks are in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/989"&gt;#989&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miscellaneous-work"&gt;Miscellaneous Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other functionalities like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;multieval&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;derivative&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;get_lc&lt;/code&gt; were also added for all the three intger polynomials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was an error in the Flint documentation, which was related with incorrect ordering of the arguments being passed to the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;divides&lt;/code&gt; function. It was reported in &lt;a href="https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/267"&gt;#267&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piranha required some implementations to be explicitly provided on the coefficient class, we are going to use. Thus, I had to overwrite some implementations like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd_impl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;pow_impl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;divexact_impl&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;SymEngine::intger_class&lt;/code&gt; to work with &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;piranha::polynomial&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;lcm&lt;/code&gt; for SymEngine polynomials, and start on &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Basic -&amp;gt; Poly&lt;/code&gt; conversion to add to the coercion framework decided for SymEngine, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! It&amp;#8217;s been four weeks at GSoC. This week, I have been working on integrations. I had a meeting with my mentors on 12th June. It was great. I got stuck while implementing the integrations of Singularity Function earlier.&amp;#160;I had already discussed that in my previous blog post.&amp;#160;But at the&amp;#160;meeting, I got some good ideas from Sartaj and Jason&amp;#160;which not only cleared my doubts but also helped me to complete the implementation&amp;#160;of integration of Singularity Functions. Firstly, they suggested me to start with the integration part in a new PR, since&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11178"&gt;PR 11178&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;was quite good enough to get merged. Secondly, to integrate the Singularity Functions having exponents -1, we need to rewrite it as &amp;#160;DiracDeltas and then to use the methods of integration which are already available&amp;#160;at sympy&amp;#160;and then again rewrite it back as Singularity Functions. &amp;#160;Now I am almost completed with the &amp;#8220;Implementation of Singularity Functions&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11178"&gt;PR 11178&lt;/a&gt;, I have&amp;#160;added the changes that Jason had suggested. This PR is now ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11237"&gt;PR 11237&lt;/a&gt;, I have almost completed implementing the integrations of Singularity Function both definite and indefinite. I have implemented methods to rewrite DiracDeltas and Heaviside back to Singularity Functions. &amp;#160;The arguments of DiracDeltas and Heavisides should be a&amp;#160;linear polynomial to use these methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have added a module named &amp;#8220;singularityfunctions&amp;#8221; in the integrals directory. In there I have defined a function &amp;#8220;singularityintegrate&amp;#8221;. This one is the core function to integrate the Singularity Functions. SingularityFunction(x, a, -1) perfectly behaves as DiracDelta(x &amp;#8211; a).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To polish&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11178"&gt;PR 11178 &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11237"&gt;PR 11237&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and get them merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To start working with Beam Bending Module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward toward an another great week. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midterm Evaluation is Coming !!! All the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/sampadblog.wordpress.com/546/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/sampadblog.wordpress.com/546/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=sampadblog.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=102728326&amp;#038;post=546&amp;#038;subd=sampadblog&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <title>GSoC Week 4</title>

      <link>http://jbm950.github.io//2016/06/17/GSoC-week-4.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started off this week writing the example code for a pendulum defined by x
and y coordinates instead of an angle, theta. This was to show how the
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;eombase.EOM&lt;/code&gt; class would handle a differential algebraic system. I also
altered the simple pendulum example I made early on in the project to show how
it would look as an &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;eombase.EOM&lt;/code&gt; example. Of the examples I have made for the
base class this one stands out as currently being the only one making use of
the equations of motion generators (the other two have the equations of motion
entered by hand). While addressing comments on the PR, it was mentioned that a
more traditional documentation approach would allow greater visibility of the
desired results of the code as the output could be explicitly shown. I agreed
and moved all three examples to a single .rst document in PyDy and changed the
code to represent the documentation format over example code format. At this
point I made a list of all of the attributes and methods I though the base
class should represent and made sure they were represented in the example
documentation. In addition I included multiple ways I thought error messages
should be brought up for incorrect uses of the base class. This information is
currently awaiting review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the work on the base class I had to fix the kane benchmark I
made early on in the project. At some point in the last few months the input
order for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;kane.kanes_equations()&lt;/code&gt; was flipped and this caused the benchmark to
not be able to run on pervious versions of Sympy. My fix was to use a
try/except clause to catch the error produced by the older versions of Sympy
and alter the input order based on whether or not the error was produced. This
code sits at &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_benchmarks/pull/29"&gt;PR #29&lt;/a&gt; and it
too is awaiting review/approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have been waiting for review of the base class PR, I have begun reading
through Roy Featherstone&amp;#8217;s book, &amp;#8220;Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms&amp;#8221;. I have spent
time going through Jason&amp;#8217;s overhaul of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt; as well and trying to
provide as much useful feedback as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I reviewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11183#issuecomment-225102295"&gt;PR
#11209&lt;/a&gt; this
week. The PR correctly alters code that tests for the presence of a key in a
dictionary. It also altered the indentation of the code that immediately
followed. I eventually came to the conclusion that this was a correct
alteration because the variable &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;eq_no&lt;/code&gt; is set in the dictionary key test and
is used in the code that follows the test. I commented that the PR looks good
to me and another member of SymPy merged it. This makes me slightly worried
that too much value may be attached to my opinion as I still feel like a
beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="future-directions"&gt;Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue reading through Featherstone&amp;#8217;s book until I recieve feedback on
the proposed base class API at which time I will address the reviewer&amp;#8217;s
comments and hopefully begin work on the base class itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prs-and-issues"&gt;PR&amp;#8217;s and Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

      <link>http://nishnik.github.io/GSoC-Third-Week/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Logo" src="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/static/img/summer-of-code-logo.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I had been working on the design of the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; class and the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisFieldDict&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Firstly, like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntDict&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisFieldDict&lt;/code&gt; was also inheriting &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ODictWrapper&lt;/code&gt;, and had the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;dict_&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;map&amp;lt;unsigned int, integer_class&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; making it a sparse representation.&lt;br /&gt;
Then &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; was inherting &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UPolyBase&lt;/code&gt;, in which the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Container&lt;/code&gt; was a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisFieldDict&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;dict_&lt;/code&gt; being a map, I made some more optimization to the code, mainly with the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; function. I gave extra attention to the fact that we can optimize insertion by providing an iterator as hint.&lt;br /&gt;
Apart from it, made a inplace copy of almost all the arithmetic and modular operations/functions. &lt;br /&gt;
Then, as we had already implemented the division operation in Finite field, so I overloaded the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Down the way, I saw one test constantly failing in Travis CI. The platform it was failing on was OSX. As I don&amp;#8217;t have access to OSX, the debugging took a long time, But after the debugging, I fixed some good bugs. It highlights the importance of writing good tests including corner cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was all fine till now. Isuru (my mentor) realized that as we have to do a lot amount of division, and in that we will have to access all the elements of map less than degree of divisor (for calculating remainder). It will take more time with &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;. So we decided to shift our &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;dict_&lt;/code&gt; type to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;std::vector&amp;lt;integer_class&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Now the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisFieldDict&lt;/code&gt; class doesn&amp;#8217;t inherit from &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ODictWrapper&lt;/code&gt; while the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; class still have the same structure. Now &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisFieldDict&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;dict_&lt;/code&gt; being a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;, I had to implement a function &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_istrip()&lt;/code&gt;, which strips off the leading zeroes, so that the degree of our polynomial can be accessed directly by &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;dict_.size()-1&lt;/code&gt; and most importantly the number of computation decreases.&lt;br /&gt;
As this work is in progress, I will post about it in the next week&amp;#8217;s post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GSoC Week 3 Progress</title>
      <author>Rajith Vidanaarachchi (rajithv)</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 19:13:04 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>https://rajithsays.wordpress.com/2016/06/12/gsoc-week-3-progress/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The week 3 in GSoC started with a backlog coming from the second week. But I was able to end the week on a happier note, by catching up with that work, and almost finishing the work assigned for this week. Apart from that, I have started reading on implementing a feature, not present in the original timeline as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to complete the work from RealMPFR and ComplexMPC wrappers, I was able to get merged, &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/972" target="_blank"&gt;PR #972&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/984" target="_blank"&gt;PR #984&lt;/a&gt; on symengine repository. The work from second week finally came to an end with &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb/pull/49" target="_blank"&gt;PR #49&lt;/a&gt; getting merged in the symengine.rb repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third week&amp;#8217;s work, Series and Polynomials had to be postponed because, the symengine developers are still finalizing them. So, I was left with Derivatives, Substitutions and Abs. Those implementations were covered with &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/982" target="_blank"&gt;PR #982&lt;/a&gt; in symengine repository and &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb/pull/50" target="_blank"&gt;PR #50&lt;/a&gt; in symengine.rb repository. &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine.rb/pull/51" target="_blank"&gt;PR #51&lt;/a&gt; is currently under review, and a discussion on probable methods to extend the FunctionSymbol initialization function is currently underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the other extra work I am going to take, it is about the eval methods. Currently the symengine has four eval methods, one each for limited precision reals and complexes, and multiple precision reals and complexes. This needs to be provided through an interfacing method, which is of the following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="_5yl5"&gt;RCP&amp;lt;const Number&amp;gt; eval(const Basic &amp;amp;b, unsigned long bits = 53, bool real=False)

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This needs to be written in C++, then wrapped in C and later in Ruby. Though I was planning to start working on it during the weekend, it was only possible to read and plan how to write the code. So next week, along with starting on the Matrices, I will look into achieving this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/rajithsays.wordpress.com/276/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/rajithsays.wordpress.com/276/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rajithsays.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=110498904&amp;#038;post=276&amp;#038;subd=rajithsays&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on wrapping Piranha polynomials within SymEngine this week. It felt much more interesting than wrapping Flint polynomials, mainly because I was reading the Piranha&amp;#8217;s source and was in direct touch with the  author of the library. Many thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/bluescarni"&gt;@bluescarni&lt;/a&gt; who helped me getting familiar with it. As before, I&amp;#8217;ll briefly summarize the work I did this week along with my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="piranha-polynomials"&gt;Piranha Polynomials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piranha&amp;#8217;s polynomial class is the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;piranha::polynomial&lt;/code&gt; class. It&amp;#8217;s templatized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Cf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;typename&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;polynomial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;power_series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two major differences about Piranha Polynomials and SymEngine polynomials. Firstly, it uses a custom unordered map implementation called &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;hash_set&lt;/code&gt; for storing it&amp;#8217;s degree-coefficient pairs. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;hash_set&lt;/code&gt; has been internally optimized for polynomial manipulations in general. On a side note, this makes SymEngine have all three types of polynomial representations too! Secondly, Piranha does not distinguish between univariate polynomials and multivariate polynomials. All polynomials are multivariate polynomials, univariate polynomials being a special case (with just one element in it&amp;#8217;s &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;symbol_set&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Cf&lt;/code&gt; is the class for storing the coefficients, while &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Key&lt;/code&gt; are the monomials themselves. Unlike Flint, we can use any integer class as the coefficient class for the polynomials. So, the first question was wether to use &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;piranha::integer&lt;/code&gt; (and use implicit conversions like I did in Flint polynomials) or &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;SymEngine::integer_class&lt;/code&gt; as the integer class for Piranha polynomials. After a brief discussion with Isuru, we decided to go with SymEngine&amp;#8217;s integers. The &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Key&lt;/code&gt; class used is &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;piranha::monomial&amp;lt;uint&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which means it will store one &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; per symbol (representing the degree, in each monomial).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="symengines-integers-in-piranhapolynomial"&gt;SymEngine&amp;#8217;s integers in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;piranha::polynomial&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an integer class to be usable as the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Cf&lt;/code&gt; it should have some basic properties like, default constructibility, copy constructibility, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nothrow&lt;/code&gt; destructibility, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nothrow&lt;/code&gt; move assignability and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nothrow&lt;/code&gt; move constructibility. As of yet, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_wrapper&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fmpz_wrapper&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_class&lt;/code&gt; did not pass the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nothrow&lt;/code&gt; checks. All that had to bee done was that I had to add &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;noexcept&lt;/code&gt; to the wrappers we had already written. This allowed &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_wrapper&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fmpz_wrapper&lt;/code&gt; to be used as coefficients in Piranha polynomials. Ofcourse, Piranha&amp;#8217;s own integer class passes all these checks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no solution for having &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_class&lt;/code&gt; as the coefficient class for polynomials. Firstly, these gmpxx integers methods have not been marked &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;nothrow&lt;/code&gt; yet. There is a forum &lt;a href="https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-devel/2016-April/004271.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on how it can be added, and actually has been added in the development version but hasn&amp;#8217;t been released yet. Another reason  is that &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_class&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates"&gt;expression templates&lt;/a&gt; for improved performance. This means that unlike normal integers, any arithmetic operation does not necessarily return the same integer class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 		&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpz_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;is_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpz_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// false
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it cannot be used within Piranha is that Piranha checks the coefficient type after each operation so that it knows what &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; the polynomial belongs to. Here, it will be unable to detect what the ring is, as the returned coefficient will be an expression template. Thus, it was decided that the integer class &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_class&lt;/code&gt; can&amp;#8217;t be used alongside Piranha with SymEngine. So, the following became invalid, on which a warning is thrown and the class is changed to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_wrapper&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake -DWITH_PIRANHA=yes -DINTEGER_CLASS=gmpxx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the work on Piranha polynomials and the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; changes can be found in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/980"&gt;#980&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="iterators"&gt;Iterators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently this is what the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; functions for our univariate integer polynomials looked like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIntPoly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// use it-&amp;gt;first and it-&amp;gt;second
&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UIntPolyFlint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;degree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// use it and p.get_coeff(it)
&lt;/span&gt;	&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These methods are very similar and do not deserve to be separate functions. All that was needed to unify these methods was to have iterators for each of the three classes, and then we can have use the same code for many functions like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;as_symbolic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;derivative&lt;/code&gt;. This also called for a new base class to be made, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntPolyBase&lt;/code&gt; from which these three integer polynomials inherit and it itself inherits from the original base class &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UPolyBase&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck with the syntax of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;it-&amp;gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;it-&amp;gt;second&lt;/code&gt; for the unified iterators. Which means &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;operator*&lt;/code&gt; needed to return a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;std::pair&amp;lt;uint, integer_class&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. So, for SymEngine polynomials all I needed to do was return iterators to the internal dictionary and that was it. Not going into too much technicality, for Flint and Piranha I used custom iterators which had &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;operator++&lt;/code&gt; defined on them and returned a pair whenever &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;it-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;*it&lt;/code&gt; was called on them. They basically iterated over the degree and returned only for non-zero coefficients for both the libraries. The actual implementation of the iterator scheme can be seen in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/985"&gt;#985&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I was happy with this approach and was able to write (unifying the three) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;string print(const UIntPolyBase&amp;amp; p)
{
	for(auto it = p.dict_.begin(); it != p.dict_.end(); ++it)
	{
		// use it-&amp;gt;first and it-&amp;gt;second
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isuru pointed out that instead of returning the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;integer_class&lt;/code&gt; in the pair, we should return a reference to it. Now, this made sense but was a bit tricky to implement. Also the iterator could no longer return reference like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;const integer_class&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, as Flint did not even store it&amp;#8217;s coefficients as &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;integer_class&lt;/code&gt;. To tackle this, another template parameter had to be added to the custom iterator class which determined the second term of the pair (which was supposed to be the reference to the coefficient in the internal storage of the polynomial). Also, I had to dig in to the Flint documentation and ask Piranha&amp;#8217;s author, for knowing how I could get &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; references to the coefficients in internal storage. After this was finally implemented, there was a new &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;get_coeff_ref&lt;/code&gt; method, which does not copy but returns a reference to the required coefficient. The only downside to all this was that instead of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;it-&amp;gt;second&lt;/code&gt; I had to use &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;to_integer_class(it-&amp;gt;second)&lt;/code&gt; everywhere in the common functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miscellaneous-work"&gt;Miscellaneous Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I saw that in SymEngine, there were lots of redundant header file includes in many files. I wrote a short python script which makes a header dependency tree, and automatically removes header includes which are not needed. After some manual inspection of the changes I pushed in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/981"&gt;#981&lt;/a&gt;. It was really amazing to see the script flag more than 500 lines of redundant includes. The PR has not been merged yet, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be working on higher level functionality like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt; in the coming week. Will keep you guys posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laters!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! It&amp;#8217;s been three weeks into the coding period, &amp;amp; I have managed to get some pace.I had a meeting with &lt;a href="https://github.com/moorepants"&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/leosartaj"&gt;Sartaj&lt;/a&gt; on 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#160;of this month.&amp;#160;We exchanged our thoughts on implementing the integration of Singularity Function objects. Then our discussion moved on towards the implementation of the Beam Bending Module. We focused on whether a Beam object will be mutable or immutable.We ended up discussing two approaches for the implementation&amp;#160;of the integration of Singularity Function objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11103"&gt;PR 11103&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11137"&gt;PR 11137&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;has finally got merged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11178"&gt;PR 11178&lt;/a&gt;, I have added two important methods under &amp;#160;Singularity Function class.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rewrite(Heaviside)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rewrite(DiracDelta)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These would help to convert a Singularity Function object into a mixture of DiracDeltas and Heavisides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while doing the inverse i.e. rewriting DiracDeltas and Heavisides I got stuck. I have implemented that in a way which can&amp;#8217;t handle a bit complex expressions,but good for simple DiracDelta and Heaviside expressions. I need to work on this method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same PR, I am also working on the integration of the Singularity Functions. There are two approaches which I have discussed with my mentors.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directly use the rules of integrations:- I mean if the&amp;#160;exponent is greater than zero then increase the exponent by 1 and divide the whole by the resulting exponent. Else just increase the exponent by 1.&lt;br /&gt;
The issue with this approach is if we perform Sympy integrations over SingularityFunction(x, a, 0) ,which is basically DiracDelta(x &amp;#8211; a), then it doesn&amp;#8217;t satisfy the fundamentals properties of DiracDelta integrations. For the purpose, I am trying the next approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Heaviside and DiracDelta :- Convert the Singularity function into expressions containing DiracDeltas and Heavisides and then integrate that. Integrations of DiracDeltas and Heavisides are already there in Sympy. Then rewrite that result back into the Singularity Function. Lastly, just output that resulting expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, I am working on rewriting the DiracDeltas and Heavisides back into the Singularity Function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue with the implementation of integrations of Singularity Functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all for now, looking forward to week 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers. Happy Coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/sampadblog.wordpress.com/431/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/sampadblog.wordpress.com/431/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=sampadblog.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=102728326&amp;#038;post=431&amp;#038;subd=sampadblog&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://jbm950.github.io//2016/06/10/GSoC-week-3.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is Friday the 10th and thus marks the end of the third week of Google
Summer of Code. This week started off with continuing work on making test code
and a base class for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt;. The work took a turn
early in the week when I started working on an example problem that would use
the base class instead of working on the base class and test code itself. This
resulted in more reading and studying of code examples. This week I also had
the opportunity to review multiple shorter PR&amp;#8217;s in addition to a longer one
that dealt directly with code in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning of this week I migrated all property attributes from
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;LagrangesMethod&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;EOM&lt;/code&gt; as a base class. This work shows
up in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11182"&gt;PR #11182&lt;/a&gt; which was
originally meant to just be a discussion on the API for the base class. It was
suggested to me to stop working on the actual implementation at this point and
work on planning out a more complete API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to come up with a more complete plan for the API for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;EOM&lt;/code&gt; I first had
to get a better understanding of what was done with the equations of motion
after the formation step. To do this I looked over
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pydy/pydy-tutorial-human-standing"&gt;pydy-tutorial-human-standing&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bmcage/odes/blob/master/docs/ipython/Planar%20Pendulum%20as%20DAE.ipynb"&gt;Planar Pendulum
Example&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.pydy.org/examples/double_pendulum.html"&gt;Double Pendulum Example&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pydy/pydy/blob/master/examples/mass_spring_damper/mass_spring_damper.ipynb"&gt;PyDy Mass Spring Damper
Example&lt;/a&gt;.
After the equations of motion are formed the most common use for them was for
time simulations using ODE integration (or DAE integration) and so the next
thing I did was look into the documentation for the integrators
(&lt;a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy.integrate.odeint"&gt;scipy.integrate.odeint&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/bmcage/odes"&gt;scikit.odes.dae&lt;/a&gt;). With this information I
was able to begin work on an example problem in for the PyDy repository that
would make use of this new class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that Pydy&amp;#8217;s &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; class performed the work of rearrangeing the
equations of motion into a form accepted by the integrators and so the main
focus of the base class is to have the attributes that system expects. After
analyzing &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;System&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8217;s internals I went ahead and created a basic example of a
base class and submitted the code in &lt;a href="https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/353"&gt;PR
#353&lt;/a&gt; in the PyDy repository. The PR
shows manual entry of the equation of motion for a system with two masses,
springs and dampers and will be used for further discussion of the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I reviewed two shorter PR&amp;#8217;s and one longer PR. The shorter PR&amp;#8217;s were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10698"&gt;PR #10698&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10693"&gt;PR
#10693&lt;/a&gt; and covered sympy
documentation. The first requested removing a docstring of one of the modules
because the module had detailed documentation online. I suggested that this
would be a negative change to sympy overall and others in sympy came to the
same conclusion and it was promptly closed. The other documentation PR had a
couple of spelling fixes but also had some negative or non-useful changes and
is currently awaiting the author to remedy the latter. The Longer PR this week
was a continuation on the Kanes Method &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11183"&gt;PR
#11183&lt;/a&gt; Jason started last week and
is an effort to improve the readibility and overall cleanliness of
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;KanesMethod&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="future-directions"&gt;Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current plan for the next steps of the project is to come up with a few
more examples of the base class in use. Once the example code has laid out an
API I will begin implementing the base class itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prs-and-issues-referenced-in-post"&gt;PR&amp;#8217;s and Issues Referenced in Post&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>GSoC Week 03 - The One With Function Range (Part II)</title>
      <author>Kshitij Saraogi(kshitij10496)</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on implementing a method for finding the range of a function in a given domain.
Following from last weeek&amp;#8217;s research on the same, I tried to develop these utility functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I have defined the two functions along with some of their implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;continuous_in(f, x, interval)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function returns the sub-domains as an &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Union&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Interval&lt;/code&gt; in case a discontinuity exists in the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;interval&lt;/code&gt;. If the function is continuous in the entire domain, the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;interval&lt;/code&gt; itself is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this we need to consider 2 primary conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain constraints for real functions&lt;/strong&gt;
I have also added some code for domain constraints in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; functions.
Using the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_univariate_inequality&lt;/code&gt; method (as the name suggests, it solves univariate inequalities),
we calculate these constraints.&lt;br /&gt;
Given &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f(x) = sqrt(g(x))&lt;/code&gt;, we determine the range of values of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; for which the function &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;g(x) &amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f(x) = log(g(x))&lt;/code&gt;, the interval of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in which &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;g(x) &amp;gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; is the constrained interval.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singularities&lt;/strong&gt;
For determining the discontinuities, I tried to solve the reciprocal of the given function using &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solveset&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;
solveset(1/f, x, interval)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;singularities&lt;/code&gt; function can also be used here but its implementation is 
restricted to rational functions only. There are possibilities of improving this function to create a universal
function which returns all the possible singularities of the function in a given domain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;function_range(f, x, domain)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the name suggests, this method returns the range of a univariate function in a given domain. This function is primarily designed for the purpose of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_decomposition&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function calls the above implemented &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;continuous_in&lt;/code&gt; method for finding the actual domain of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;. Following this, we iterate over each &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Interval&lt;/code&gt; object returned by &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;continuous_in&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the boundaries of the interval and first derivate test, we determine the crtical points in the interval 
and their corresponding critical values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For determining the values of the function at the singularities, we determine its limit at that point. 
For this, I use the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;limit&lt;/code&gt; function of SymPy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After calculating the local extremas, I calculate the global minima and maxima using the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;inf&lt;/code&gt;(infimum) and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;sup&lt;/code&gt;(supremum) of the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;FiniteSet&lt;/code&gt; of all critical values. The range, which is the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;Interval&lt;/code&gt; of these extremasm, is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="git-log"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$ git log&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11141"&gt;PR#11141&lt;/a&gt;: Method for solving equations using Decomposition and Rewriting
&lt;em&gt;Opened this week&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11224"&gt;PR#11224&lt;/a&gt;: Methods for finding the range of a function in a given domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was all for this week.&lt;br /&gt;
My task for the upcoming days would be to update my &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solve_decomposition&lt;/code&gt; method to accomodate these methods.
I aim to get all these PR merged before the midterm evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id="continue-simplified-solution-for-trigonometric-equation"&gt;Continue: Simplified solution for Trigonometric Equation:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188"&gt;#11188&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Problems :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I tried more testcases having sqrt and other types I found new issues on &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;reduce_imageset&lt;/code&gt; method. Some of the Simplified
solutions contains undesired &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in solveset/_solve_radical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_solve_radical&lt;/code&gt; may get &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;exp(I*x)&lt;/code&gt; terms and solving them we give Imageset, I added the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if isinstance(result, ImageSet) or any(isinstance(r, ImageSet) for r in result.args):
        return result
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factor_list&lt;/code&gt; in solve_trig :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many cases we can do factor of expression and solve each factor may give us more simplified solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I added the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factor_list&lt;/code&gt; and solving each factors and union the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I analyzed how &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; form is solved and found correct order to use &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factor&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factor_list&lt;/code&gt; ,the summery
is in this &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/Shekharrajak/17fdcd2320f572fc9fc8674823137e20"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I implemented the above order and shifted the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;reduce_imageset&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_union&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ImageSet&lt;/code&gt;.
I created &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_union_simiplify&lt;/code&gt; a helper method for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_union&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;_union_simplify&lt;/code&gt; better than my previous implementation :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous implementation was returning solution in simplified &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ImageSet&lt;/code&gt;, although it passed the all
test-case except 2-3 cases. But these 2-3 test-cases taught me you are doing over simplification.
So now I understood that we should not simplify the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ImageSet(s)&lt;/code&gt; of the one factor solution, it may get simplified
with other factor solution ImageSet(s).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplify them if there is difference of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt;, that means club [(2&lt;em&gt;n + 1) and (2&lt;/em&gt;n) =&amp;gt; (n&lt;em&gt;pi)] or [(2&lt;/em&gt;n* + 1)
and (2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;pi + 2) =&amp;gt; (n*pi)].&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So now _solve_trig uses factor_list for trig eq and then solve each factor F_i. To solve each factor F_i first do
F_i.rewrite(exp) and get this exp form factors F_ij so now the unnecessary exp will come out that dont contribute in
final solution. That&amp;#8217;s why we get simplified &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ImageSet&lt;/code&gt; that will be Union with previous solution. Inside the
Union =&amp;gt; _union =&amp;gt; _union_simplify checks for simplification with already present &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ImageSet&lt;/code&gt;. This is the process
till last factor F_i.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After working on blog for 1 week created my own blog template powered by Jekyll. and shifted the old blog into github.
PR for the blog link update in planet: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/planet-sympy/pull/42"&gt;pull/42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I edited my old template(already hosted on &lt;a href="http://s-hacker.info"&gt;s-hacker.info&lt;/a&gt;) to make it mobile responsive. Now it works perfectly for mobile. &lt;a href="http://shekharrajak.github.io/"&gt;shekharrajak.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Found a issue in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factor_list&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11198"&gt;issues/11198&lt;/a&gt; , When I passed
&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;f = sqrt(2)*sin(x) -1&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;solveset&lt;/code&gt; I got this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factor_list&lt;/code&gt; issue I opened a PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11201"&gt;pull/11201&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I wrote&amp;#160;in my blog post last week, Our&amp;#160;plan was to implement numerical methods to compute values of a Holonomic function at given points and convert symbolic function/expressions. Let&amp;#8217;s look at what I implemented during this time&amp;#160;one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by working on to implement the most basic and popular &lt;code&gt;Euler's method&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;for numerical integration of holonomic ode&amp;#8217;s. Given a set a points in the complex plane, the algorithm computes numerical values of Holonomic function at each point using the Euler&amp;#8217;s method.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11180"&gt;#11180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I moved on to write a method for converting Meijer G-function to a Holonomic Function. In the module &lt;code&gt;meijerint&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;we have method &lt;code&gt;meijerint._rewrite1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;to convert expressions/functions to &lt;code&gt;meijerg&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;. Now this method can be used first to convert to &lt;code&gt;meijerg&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;and then converting this result finally to Holonomic Functions. I wrote methods&amp;#160;&lt;code&gt;from_meijerg&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;and &lt;code&gt;from_sympy&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;respectively for this purposes. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11187"&gt;#11187&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also familiar with the fact that &lt;code&gt;Euler's method&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;doesn&amp;#8217;t give much accurate results and for better accuracy one needs higher order numerical methods e.g. Runge-Kutta 4th Order method A.K.A &lt;code&gt;RK4&lt;/code&gt; method. I wrote this method and made it the default method for numerical computation. As expected, the results are much more accurate using RK4 and enough for our present purposes. &lt;a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11195"&gt;#11195&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now looking for bugs inside everything implemented so far in the module, will be working on solving them and also will make things optimal wherever there is a possibility. More on what to implement next is yet to be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank You!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/shubhamtibra.wordpress.com/291/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/shubhamtibra.wordpress.com/291/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=shubhamtibra.wordpress.com&amp;#038;blog=106149936&amp;#038;post=291&amp;#038;subd=shubhamtibra&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" /&gt;</description>

      <title>GSoC Second Week</title>
      <author>Nishant Nikhil (nishnik)</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <link>http://nishnik.github.io/GSoC-Second-Week/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Logo" src="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/static/img/summer-of-code-logo.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I implemented some algorithms (&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_div&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_gcd&lt;/code&gt; etc.) and apart from it I looked into the design consideration also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="algorithms-implemented"&gt;Algorithms Implemented&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented 
- &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_div&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C+++"&gt;void GaloisFieldDict::gf_div(const GaloisFieldDict &amp;amp;o,
                         const Ptr&amp;lt;GaloisFieldDict&amp;gt; &amp;amp;quo,
                         const Ptr&amp;lt;GaloisFieldDict&amp;gt; &amp;amp;rem) const
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will change the value of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;quo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_quo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return the quotient only. It will help when we only need quotient after dividing.
It is better than &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_div&lt;/code&gt; in terms of time complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_lshift&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is efficient way to multiply a polynomial in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x**n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_rshift&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is efficient way to divide a polynomial in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x**n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-C++"&gt;void GaloisFieldDict::gf_rshift(const integer_class n,
                            const Ptr&amp;lt;GaloisFieldDict&amp;gt; &amp;amp;quo,
                            const Ptr&amp;lt;GaloisFieldDict&amp;gt; &amp;amp;rem) const
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like gf_div, it also changes the value of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;quo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_sqr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will square the polynomial in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_pow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses binary multiplication to power a polynomial in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_monic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes a polynomial to its monic representation, i.e. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;3*x**2 + 4&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GF(5)&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;x**2 + 3&lt;/code&gt;. Here leading coefficient becomes &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;one&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_gcd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_lcm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_gcd&lt;/code&gt; by Euclidean Algorithm and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gf_lcm&lt;/code&gt; is product of the two polys divided by their gcd in the finite field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="design-change"&gt;Design Change&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SymEngine&amp;#8217;s codebase for &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntPoly&lt;/code&gt; has changed, it inherits &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UPolyBase&lt;/code&gt;, which has two private variables, one is to store the variable and other is container. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntPoly&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntDict&lt;/code&gt; as a container and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntDict&lt;/code&gt; is inherited from &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;ODictWrapper&lt;/code&gt;.
Now as &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; is just representation of polynomial so I needed something similar, so I made &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisField&lt;/code&gt; inherit from &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UPolyBase&lt;/code&gt;, and made a container named &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;GaloisFieldDict&lt;/code&gt;.
This prevented a lot of code duplicacy.
Still there is a lot of conversation going on this topic, I will better post after the final design is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has not been as interesting as the last. Most of my work this week involved wrapping Flint Polynomials, for use in SymEngine. I will discuss their internal implementation and how they were integrated to the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="flint-polynomials"&gt;Flint Polynomials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flint&amp;#8217;s integer polynomial class is the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fmpz_poly&lt;/code&gt; class. Flint, being a C library also provides a C++ wrapper for most of it&amp;#8217;s classes. In our case, it&amp;#8217;s the &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fmpz_polyxx&lt;/code&gt; class. As discussed last week, the arithmetic operators for the class have already been overloaded and it can be seamlessly used with the base class which is already set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, flint uses a dense representation of polynomials. What this means is that the coefficient for each degree in the polynomial are stored in a vector. This is in contrast to a sparse approach which deals stores only non-zero coefficients of a polynomial in a dictionary. Flint also uses it&amp;#8217;s own integer class as the coefficient type. Flint&amp;#8217;s integers are basically similar to GMP integers, and also follow the same naming conventions. (eg. &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fmpz_t&lt;/code&gt; is analogous to &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;mpz_t&lt;/code&gt;) They have internal optimizations to make them faster for use within the flint library itself. Flint does not provide the option to use a custom integer class as the type of coefficients like Piranha does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the work related to flint polynomials can be seen in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/971"&gt;#971&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the PR concerns introducing a new class &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntPolyFlint&lt;/code&gt; and all the necessary functionality like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;__hash__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;. Test cases have also been added, to see if the polynomial manipulation is working as intended. There is some additional minor work done here apart from this class introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polynomial base class now has three methods :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Poly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from_container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Poly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Poly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from_vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods are, as indicated from their names, used to construct the polynomial from any of the three sources. So, for example to construct a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntPolyFlint&lt;/code&gt;, you can :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PolyFlint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PolyFlint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fmpz_polyxx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PolyFlint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PolyFlint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;integer_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PolyFlint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PolyFlint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;integer_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="integerclass-conversions"&gt;&lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;integer_class&lt;/code&gt; Conversions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue was that methods like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; must return integers of &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;integer_class&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, we needed functions to convert &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;fmpzxx&lt;/code&gt; to any of the 4 possible integer classes used by SymEngine. The 4 integers used by SymEngine are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. mpz_class         The default C++ class provided by GMP
2. mpz_wrapper       SymEngine's wrapper around GMP's mpz_t
3. piranha::integer  Piranha's integer class
3. fmpz_wrapper      SymEngine's wrapper around Flint's fmpz_t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, might even require such conversion for Piranha polynomials. So, I generalized this and made &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;to_integer_class()&lt;/code&gt; which takes in either &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;flint::fmpzxx&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;piranha::integer&lt;/code&gt; and returns an &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;integer_class&lt;/code&gt;. There was a small discussion on where these functions should be placed, with Isuru which was insightful. Basically, what I was doing earlier caused a considerable &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/971#issuecomment-223743950"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; in compilation time, which was later corrected. An example of one such function is :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#if SYMENGINE_INTEGER_CLASS == GMP || GMPXX
#ifdef HAVE_SYMENGINE_FLINT
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;inline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;integer_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_integer_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fmpzxx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;integer_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmpz_get_mpz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_mpz_t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#endif
#endif
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;get_coeff()&lt;/code&gt; function was also added to the polynomial base is a much needed function for any polynomial manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miscellaneous-work"&gt;Miscellaneous Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were some changes done to the polynomial structure before the flint polynomials were introduced. Constructor of the polynomials from vectors was removed, as it wasn&amp;#8217;t required. And a &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;from_vec&lt;/code&gt; was added for the SymEngine polynomial dictionaries &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UIntDict&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;UExprDict&lt;/code&gt;. The changes can be seen here &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/965/"&gt;#965&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Travis CI builds, SymEngine was using flint-2.4.4 from a static location. There&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/217"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; that I encountered using this version, which dealt with incorrect header declaration in one of the flint files. Now, we clone the flint repository from  &lt;a href="https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/"&gt;wbhart/flint2&lt;/a&gt; to use in the CI builds. The change is in &lt;a href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine/pull/973"&gt;#973&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working on wrapping Piranha polynomials next week. After that is done, I plan to start getting higher level functionality like &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="highlighter-rouge"&gt;factorize&lt;/code&gt; ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
